# lang.py.module.regex

Python's module for working with regular expressions (regex)

## Synopsis

```py
  import re
```

## Overview

You can use this moduele to perform [regex](./cbw4.md) operations inside of
your script

You can also use the `regex` moudle since It's **backwards compatibale with
the** `re` module but with additional functionality. This is **not part of the
standard library** for that just use `re`

**Pattern strings** that contain **backslash** special characters, must be
prefix with a `r`

### Module functions

- `re.findall()`: Returns a list with all the matches
- `re.split()`: Split a string based on the match character
- `re.sub()`: Replace the matched pattern on a given string
- `re.subn()`: Like `sub()` but return a tupple of new string and number of
  replacements done replacements
- `re.search()`: Returns a `match object` if it matches the string, else `None`

### Match Object

Is the basic object that the **module instantiates** when it finds a match with
`re.search()`

It has **some usefull** [class](./unhs.md) methods:

- `match.group()`: Returns the matches that were found, and captured groups
  - It can also **accept indices** in which case it return a [tuple](./hsr4.md)
  - Otherwise it will return the matches as a single space separated string

## Cookbook

### Test if the regex finds a match in the string

If you wanted to use this in some **conditional** operation, to execute some
block **if a match is found**, you can use `re.search()`

Keep in mind that this wil return a `match object`, but since is **different
from 0** is treated a [truthy](./6auy.md) and so it pasess the test. In case it **dosn't
find a match** it will **return** `None`

Also remember that this **dosen't need to match the whole string** it just
needs to find **some or any match** inside the string

```py
  string = "Python is fun"

  match = re.search(r'^Python', string)

  if match:
    print("pattern found inside the string")
  else:
    print("pattern not found")
```

### Find if a regex matches the whole string

If you wanted to **test if the regex matches** the **whole string** then you
can do that with the help of `group()`

```py
  string = "Python is fun"
  string2 = "PYTHON IS FUN"

  match = re.search('^Python', string)
  match2 = re.search('[A-Z]*', string)

  print(bool(match.group() == string))      # False
  print(bool(match2.group() == string2))      # True
```

### Perform substring substitution

You can perform substitutions based on matched regex characters like in [sed](./i6f5.md)
with `sub()`

By defult it will **replace all matches** (`0`) unless you provide an **optional**
`count` for the number of matches to be replaced

In this example we are **gettin rid of all whitespace characters**

```py
# multiline string
  string = 'abc 12\
  de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
  pattern = r'\s+'

# empty string
  replace = ''

  new_string = re.sub(pattern, replace, string)
  print(new_string)         # abc12de23f456
```

### Construct a list of all the matches

If you wanted to have all matches in a [list](./7cxo.md) you can use `findall()`

```py
  string = 'hello 12 hi 89. Howdy 34'
  pattern = r'\d+'

  result = re.findall(pattern, string)
  print(result)         # ['12', '89', '34']
```

### Split a string based on a regex delimeter

For most cases the **list** `split()` method will be more than enough to split
a list based on some **specified delimeter**.

But if you wanted to specify a **more complex** delimeter you could do so
**with a regex** by `re.split()`

```py
  string = 'Twelve:12 Eighty nine:89.'
  pattern = r'\d+'

  result = re.split(pattern, string)
  print(result)           # ['Twelve:', ' Eighty nine:', '.']
```

### Match a special character as a literal string

With regex you can **scape special characters** or **add special characters**
with `backslash` character.

But if you wanted to match those special characters in your **regex
expression**  then you can **prefix the regex with** `r` for **raw string**

```py
  string = '\n and \r are escape sequences.'

  result = re.findall(r'[\n\r]', string)
  print(result)         # ['\n', '\r']
```
