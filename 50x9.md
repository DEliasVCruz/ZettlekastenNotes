### Partially apply arguments to a function

There might be times when you may:

- Want to pass a function as a calable, but it needs some
  initial arguments to be passed
- You want to pre-pass argumets to a function

Then you can use the `partial` function to partially
pass arguments to a function

- This is similar to creating a closure for your
  function that accepts arguments
- You can pass as many arguments as needed

```py
  from functools import partial

  def use_callable(func):
      func()

  def my_func(arg, arg2):
      print(f"Hello {arg}, {arg2}")

  use_callable(partial(my_func, world, Daniel))
# Hello world, Daniel
```
