# cli.sed

A stream editor that can perform basic text manipulation on files and input
streams such as pipelines.

## Overview

With `sed` you can search, find and replace, insert, and delete words and
lines. It **supports basic and extended regular expressions** that allow you to
match complex patterns.

But `sed` can do more than just that, is a **full feature stream editor** just
that most people mostly use it's **substitute** command

You can do much more than text substitution with `sed` such as adding and
deleting lines

## Synopsis

```sh
  sed [options] "s/search_regex/replacement/g" <inputfile>
```

## Options

- `-i`: Write changes to the input file
- `-r`: Use extended regular expressions
- `-n`: Don't default to printing each line

## Commands

- `s`: The substitute command
- `g`: Replace every occurrence of the `search_regex`
- `\b`: Ensure partial words are not matched
- `&`: Placeholder replaced by the matched pattern
- `p`: Print the changed lines

## Cookbook

### Preview the results of your command

You can use the `-n` option alongside the `p` command to get a preview of the
changed lines of your command

```sh
  sed -rn "s/#(ja_JP\.UTF.*)/\1/p" /etc/locale.gen
```

### Avoid matching partial words

In it's **default behavior** it will match the **literal string**, **if you
don't want** to match occurrences where the string is a part of another full
word, you can **use** the **word-boundary** expression `\b` at **both ends of
the search** string

```sh
  sed -i "s/\bsearch_regex\b/replacement/g" <inputfile>
```

### Deal with search characters that are similar to your delimiter

Some search strings might be the same as the **usual delimiter character** `/`,
this can be **solved by** either:

**Escaping** the character with \ **before each occurrence**

```sh
  sed -i "s/\/scaped\/path\//replacement/g" <inputfile>
```

Or just **use** a **different delimiter character** like in this case `:`

```sh
  sed -i "s:/path/to/file/:replacement:g" <inputfile>
```

### Reference the searched pattern

You can **use the searched pattern in the replacement**, so that it can be used
multiple times

In this **example** it will add curly braces {} around each 3 digit number:

```sh
  sed -i "s/\b[0-9]\{3\}\b/{&}/g" <inputfile>
```

### Reference a capture group

When you use a capture group `()` you can reference by escaping a number that
references the order of the capture group

```sh
  sed -i -r "s/#(ja_JP\.UTF.*)/\1/g" /etc/locale.gen
```

### Save the original files as a backup

It is always a good idea to **make a backup** when editing a file. By appending
a `.bak` extension to the `-i` option, it wil save the original files as
`<inputfile>.bak`

```sh
  sed -i.bak "s/foo/bar/g" <inputfile>
```

### Pipe a list of files to perform the change on

Sometimes you'll want to change the **matching regex expression on multiple files**,
you can achive this by piping the list of files with a [grep like](./pgbs.md) program
and runing the command with [xargs](./b9tn.md) 

> The range of lines is inclusive

```sh
  rg --files-with-matches 'foo' | xargs sed -i -r "s/foo/bar/g"
```

### Perform a replacement for a range of lines

You can specify only a range of lines to be replaced by passing a `,` speparated
range of lines before starting the substitution

```sh
sed "0,12/s/Apple/Bannana/" # Replace only from first line to 12th line
```

### Replace only the first occurence of a match in a file

You can also use a [regex](./cbw4.md) expression to specify the range, with the
`GNU` version of `sed` we can use this to only match and replace the first
occurrence of a **search term** in the whole file

> You can use the `//` empty serach term to use the previous regex of
> the range

```sh
sed "0,/Apple/s//Bannana/;b"
```
