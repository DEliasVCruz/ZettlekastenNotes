# cli.sed

A stream editor that can perform basic text manipulation on files and input
streams such as pipelines.

## Overview

With `sed` you can search, find and replace, insert, and delete words and
lines. It **supports basic and extended regular expressions** that allow you to
match complex patterns.

But `sed` can do more than just that, is a **full feature stream editor** just
that most people mostly use it's **substitute** command

## Synopsis

```sh
  sed [options] "s/search_regex/replacement/g" <inputfile>
```

## Options

- -i: Write changes to the input file
- -r: Use extended regular expressions

## Commands

- s: The substitute command
- g: Replace every occurrence of the `search_regex`
- \b: Ensure partial words are not matched
- &: Placeholder replaced by the matched pattern

## Cookbook

### Avoid matching partial words

In it's **default behavior** it will match the **literal string**, **if you
don't want** to match occurrences where the string is a part of another full
word, you can **use** the **word-boundary** expression `\b` at **both ends of
the search** string

```sh
  sed -i "s/\bsearch_regex\b/replacement/g" <inputfile>
```

### Deal with search characters that are similar to your delimiter

Some search strings might be the same as the **usual delimiter character** `/`,
this can be **solved by** either:

**Escaping** the character with \ **before each occurrence**

```sh
  sed -i "s/\/scaped\/path\//replacement/g" <inputfile>
```

Or just **use** a **different delimiter character** like in this case `:`

```sh
  sed -i "s:/path/to/file/:replacement:g" <inputfile>
```

### Reference the searched pattern

You can **use the searched pattern in the replacement**, so that it can be used
multiple times

In this **example** it will add curly braces {} around each 3 digit number:

```sh
  sed -i "s/\b[0-9]\{3\}\b/{&}/g" <inputfile>
```

### Save the original files as a backup

It is always a good idea to **make a backup** when editing a file. By appending
a `.bak` extension to the `-i` option, it wil save the original files as
`<inputfile>.bak`

```sh
  sed -i.bak "s/foo/bar/g" <inputfile>
```
