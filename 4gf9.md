# lang.py.module.excel.openpyxl.chart

Add charts of your data inside a sheet

## Synopsis

```py
  from openpyxl.chart import <Type>Chart, Reference

  chart = <Type>Chart()
  data = Reference(worksheet=<sheet>,
                   <min-row>, <max-row>, <min-col>, <max-col>)

  chart.add_data(data)
  sheet.add_chart(chart, <cell>)
```

## Overview

To create a chart the basic structure goes as follow:

- Create a `Chart()` class instance
- Create a `Reference()` class instance
  - This will indicate the axis of your dataset
- Add the data specified with the `Reference()` instance to the chart
- Add the chart to the spreedsheet

## Cookbook

### Create a chart

There are different type of charts you can create like:

- `BarChart()`: Create a barchart
- `LineChart()`: Create a linechart

The data has to be specified with the `Reference()` class:

- `worksheet`: The worksheet where the data is located
- `min-row`: The starting row where the data is contained
- `max-row`: The ending row where the data is contained
- `min-col`: The starting column where the data is contained
- `max-col`: The ending column where the data is contained

Then you just add the data to the chart:

- `.add_data()`: Add the data to the chart object
  - The **first argument** takes and instance of the `Reference` class
  - `titles_from_data`: A boolean of wheter the rows and columns can serve as labels

Finally you add the chart to the sheet and **specify** the **top left anchor**
for the chart with the `add_chart()` method of the [sheet](./tmox.md) object

```py
  chart = BarChart()
  data = Reference(worksheet=sheet,
                   min_row=1,
                   max_row=8,
                   min_col=2,
                   max_col=3)


  chart.add_data(data, titles_from_data=True)
  sheet.add_chart(chart, "E2")
```

### Create a chart with the columns as "y axis"

This is the default mode of creating a chart, here the colums will be taken as
reference for the values in the `y axis`

Therefore in your `Reference()` instance the `min_col` has to point to the
first column with the data label values rather than from the start of the
matrix

The **rows** then start from the **top of the matrix**

```py
  chart = BarChart()
  data = Reference(worksheet=sheet,
                   min_row=1,           # Begin from the first row
                   max_row=8,
                   min_col=2,           # Start from the second colum
                   max_col=3)
```

### Create a chart with the rows as "y axis"

If for instance you wanted to have the values from the rows as your `y axis`
values and the chart labels

You would have to set in your `Reference()` instance the `min_row` to the first
cell with the row labels rather than from the start of the matrix, and your
`min_col` will point to the first column in your matrix

Additionally, when adding the data to the chart with `add_data`, you will have
to specify the `from_rows=True` parameter

```p k
  chart = LineChart()
  data = Reference(worksheet=sheet,
                   min_row=2,           # Start from the first row with label value
                   max_row=4,
                   min_col=1,           # Start from the begining of the matrix
                   max_col=13)


  chart.add_data(data, from_rows=True, titles_from_data=True)
  sheet.add_chart(chart, "C6")
```

### Define a row values as the x axis label names

If you wanted to specify the names for you `x axis` label you can do it by
passing and instance of the `Reference()` class, with the range that holds the
values, to the `set_categoies()` method of your chart

```py
  cats = Reference(worksheet=sheet,
                  min_row=1,            # Range of values for your categories
                   max_row=1,
                   min_col=2,
                   max_col=13)

  chart.set_categories(cats)
```

### Add x and y title labels

You can add titles for both the x and y axis with the `[x|y]_axis.title`
attribute of the chart object

```py
  chart.x_axis.title = "Months"
  chart.y_axis.title = "Sales (per unit)"
```
