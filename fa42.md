# linux.user

User management (create, delete, list) in linux systems

## Overview

**Multiple users can operate** in a linux machine with different profiles,
even at the same time

## Commands

- [useradd](./85wg.md): Create new users
- [userdel](): Delete a user
- [passwd](): Create, delete or modify a password for a user
- [usermod](): Make changes related to a user
- [getent](./kwye.md): Displays entries form databases in `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file

## Cookbook

### List all of the users

Local **user information** is **stored** in the `/etc/passwd` file. Each line
has **seven fields** delimited by colons:

- User name
- Encrypted password (x means is [stored](./oqfv.md) in the `/etc/shadow` file)
- User ID
- User group ID
- Full name of the user
- User home directory
- Login shell (default `/bin/bash`)

### Add a new user

You can add a new user with the `useradd` command

```sh
  useradd -G wheel -m daniel
```

### Delete a user

You can use the `userdel` command to delete a user

```sh
  userdel -r <user-name>
```

### Add a user into a group

You can either add a user into a secondary group, either:

- When you first crated with the `useradd -G` command
- After you've created with the `usermod -a -G` command

```sh
  useradd -G <group> <new-user>
  usermod -a -G <group> <existing-user>
```

### Create a user with no password

You can create a user and give it an empty password by passing the `-d` option
to the `passwd` command to delete it's password

With this you can login and do operations as that user without requiring a
password

```sh
  useradd -m <user-name>
  passwd -d <user-name>
```
