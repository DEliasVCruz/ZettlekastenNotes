# cli.py.debug.pdb.breakpoint

Manage the setting of breakpoints in your code

## Synopsis

```pdb
  (Pdb) b [<file>][:linenum][, <condition>]
```

## Overview

You can set breakpoints in your code execution **directly from** the `pdb`
**interface** and even **set conditional triggering** of breakpoints

This will stop execution of your code and allow you to run more
[commands](./i158.md)

## Cookbook

### Set a new breakpoint

You can set a new breakpoint with the `b` command and either:

- Pass `[<filename>]:linenumber` to indicate the line where to set it
  - The `<filename>` is **optional** and will **default to current file**

```pdb
  b my_file:5           # Set a breakpoint at line 5 in the 'my_file' file
```

- Pass the **name of a function or class** to stop whenever is called

```pbd
  b my_file.my_func     # Set a breakpoints at calls of `my_func`
```

### Set a conditional breakpoint

You can set a breakpoint that will be **trigger once** a certain **condition is
met**. This condition can be **specified with** a `Python` **expression** that
**evaluates** to `True`

Keep in mind that the **condition** will only be **evaluated when** the **line
or function** name that it was **set to is stepped over**

```pdb
  b my_file:5, my_var < 5  # Break if at line 5 'my_var' is less than 5
```

### Get a list of all breakpoints

You can get a **list** of all the **currently available breakpoints** by
passing the `c` command **with no arguments**

```pdb
  (Pdb) b
  Num Type         Disp Enb   Where
  1   breakpoint   keep yes   at /code/my_file.py:1
```

### Disable and re-enable breakpoints

You can disable breakpoint and enable them back again with the `disable` and
`enable` commands

They **take as the argument** the `break` **number** that appears when you
**list** all your **breakpoints** with `b`

```pdb
  (Pdb) disable 1             # Disable breakpoint 1
  (Pdb) enable 1              # Enable breakpoint 1
```
