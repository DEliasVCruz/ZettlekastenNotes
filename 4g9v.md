# lang.py.oper.statement

A simple statements is comprised within a single logical line

## Overview

There are **different type of simple statements** that can be useful depending
on where they are placed in your script

### Assert statement

Is convenient way to insert debugging assertions, unlike other test, **they will
automatically raise** an `AsertionError` [error](./t7gf.md) if failed

```py
  # assert <expression>[, <custom_error_message>]

  assert 5 > 10, "Not cool"     # AsertionError: Not cool
```

### Pass statement

It will prompt python to **move to the next block of code**. It differes from
`continue` as it will **not necessarily move** to the **next loop** iteration.

It's **NOT RECOMMENDED OVER** `continue`!!!

```py
  for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
      pass
    print(i)

  # 1 3 5 7 9
```

### Return statement

Inside a function it will output the **return value and exit the function**

```py
  def my_fun(a, b):
    if a > b:
      return "Is greater"
    return "Is not greater"
```

You can also pass a **conditioal expression as a return value**

```py
  def min(a, b):
      return a if a < b else b
```

### Yield statement

Unlike `return` this **will not exit** out of your **function**. You can still
do operations after it

```py
  def my_generator():
    <operations>
    yield <value>
    [<operations>]
```

### Raise Statement

Is used to **raise an** [exception](./wvgx.md) error, you can raise on of the standard
[errors](./t7gf.md) or a custom error define a custom error message for your raised
exception

```py
  def raise_example():
    raise TypeError('Exception Example')
```

### Break statement

It **may only be used inside** a `for` or `while` loop in any nested level, but
it **may not occur inside a nested function or class** definition within that
loop.

This will **stop the current loop** and continue to the next block

```py
  numbers = [1, 2, 3]

  for num in numbers:
      if num > 2:
          break
```

### Continue statement

It **may only be used inside** a `for` or `while` loop in any nested level, but
it **may not occur inside a nested function or class** definition within that
loop.

It will continue with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop, it
effectively **moves to the next loop**

```py
  numbers = [1, 2, 3]

  for num in numbers:
      if num > 2:
          continue
      print(num)

  # 1 3
```

### Import statement

Import different modules to use in your script

```py
  import collections
  import calendar as cal
  from csv import DictReader
```
