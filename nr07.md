# cli.git.commit

Commit your changes to your repo

## Synopsis

```sh
  git commit [options] [<commitmessage>]
```

## Options

- -a: Add files
- -m: Inline message
- --v: Puts the diff of your changes as a comment
- --amend: Change you commit message and add any unstaged file you forgot
- --no-edit: Keep your previous commit mesage when using `amend`

## CookBook

### Correct/modify your current commit

- Should be used **for minor changes**
- Only works if you **haven't already pushed to a remote**

If you want to **change the commit message** of an already commited change or
**add some unstaged files** that you may have **forgotten to staged** in the commit

On it's own it will just change the message **of the commit your head is pointing to**

If you want **to add a file, pass the name of a modified file**

```sh
  git commit --amend [file] [<edit-flags>]
```

Or only **update** the commit with **new files** and **no commit message edit** :

```sh
  git add <files>
  git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### Show or see what changes where made in a commit

It will show you **what was added or removed** in comparison to the previous
commit

The command alone defaults to current HEAD

```sh
  git show [<commitid>|<branchname>]
```

### Overwrite autorship and date

You can **modify the author(s), and date** that are asociated with the commit.
Since **by defautl** git will use the **current user and date** as the author
and date of the commit

```sh
  git commit --author="<authorship>" --date="<date>"
```
