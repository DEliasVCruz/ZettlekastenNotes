## Cookbook

### Correct/modify your current commit

- Should be used **for minor changes**
- Only works if you **haven't already pushed to a remote**

If you want to **change the commit message** of an already commited change or
**add some unstaged files** that you may have **forgotten to staged** in the commit

On it's own it will just change the message **of the commit your head is
pointing to**

If you want **to add a file, pass the name of a modified file**

```sh
  git commit --amend [file] [<edit-flags>]
```

Or only **update** the commit with **new files** and **no commit message edit** :

```sh
  git add <files>
  git commit --amend --no-edit
```

After ammending a commit, **if the commit has already been**
[pushed](./0atb.md) to a remote you have to **either** [merge](./drni.md) the
ammend commit to the **remote branch or force push** it

### Show or see what changes where made in a commit

You can use `git show` to see **what was added or removed** 
in the specified commit or [branch](./j4in.md).

> The command alone defaults to current HEAD

```sh
  git show [<commitid>|<branchname>]
```

### Get a summary of changes in a commit

You can use the `--stat` flag in `git show` to also display
the stats of changes made in the commit or branch.

```sh
git show [<commit-id>|<branch-name>] --stat
```

### View specific file changes for a commit

You want to see what changes were made to an specific file
on a commit, you can use the `--` separator to specify
a file path to apply it to.

```sh
git show [<commit-id>|<branch-name>] -- <filepath>
```

### Overwrite autorship and date

You can **modify the author(s), and date** that are asociated with the commit.
Since **by defautl** git will use the **current user and date** as the author
and date of the commit

```sh
  git commit --author="<authorship>" --date="<date>"
```

### Recovering lost commits

For this you can use [reflog](./ecyd.md) as guide to recover lost commits
