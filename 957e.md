Specially defined data structures

## Synopsis

```c
struct point {
  int x;
  int y;
}

struct point p;
```

## Overview

You can define your own data structures, that are collections of 
different data types into on single data structure, this helps
when passing complex sets of data into functions or when it makes
sensonde to have all this data types together

When the `struct` is allocated, it's `size` it's equl to the sum of the
sizes of each of it's intenal [data types](./e6e6.md), they are also stored 
as a **continues block of memory**

You can access the elements of a `struct` with the `.` operator

## Cookbook

### Define a structure `type` with the `typedef` keyword

Normally after defining a `struct`, to then define a variable using 
that struct, we will need to use `struct <struct-name> <var-name>`

This can get very tedious, and so we can use the `typedef` keyword
to define a new `type` using the `struct`

```sh
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
  char *name;
} point;

point p;

p.x = 5;
p.y = 5;
p.name = "Vector"
```

### Dereference a structure pointer and access it's members

Normally if you want to dereference a pointer and access it's
elements you need to use this syntax

```c
void move(point *p) {
  (*p).x++;
  (*p).y++;
}
```

But since this is a very common operation there is a short hand
syntax to do this same operation, accessing the element by using
the `->` (arrow) accessor

> Remember that you MUST dereference a structure pointer before
> accessing it's members

```c
void move(point *p) {
  p->x++;
  p->y++;
}
```
