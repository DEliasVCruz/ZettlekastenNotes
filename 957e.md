Specially defined data structures

## Synopsis

```c
struct point {
  int x;
  int y;
}

struct point p;
```

## Overview

You can define your own data structures, that are collections of 
different data types into on single data structure, this helps
when passing complex sets of data into functions or when it makes
sensonde to have all this data types together

When the `struct` is allocated, it's `size` it's equl to the sum of the
sizes of each of it's intenal [data types](./e6e6.md), they are also stored 
as a **continues block of memory**

You can access the elements of a `struct` with the `.` operator

## Cookbook

### Define a structure `type` with the `typedef` keyword

Normally after defining a `struct`, to then define a variable using 
that struct, we will need to use `struct <struct-name> <var-name>`

This can get very tedious, and so we can use the `typedef` keyword
to define a new `type` using the `struct`

```sh
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
  char *name;
} point;

point p;

p.x = 5;
p.y = 5;
p.name = "Vector"
```

### Initialize a struct

You can initialize a `struct` by putting it's values inside `{}`
in the order of which they are define in the struct

Or you can put them in any order by specifying their name
and value with a `.<name> = value`

```c
typedef struct {
  char *name;
  short age;
} person;

person person_1 = {"Daniel", 26};
person person_2 = {.age = 26, .name = "Daniel"};
```

### Dereference a structure pointer and access it's members

Normally if you want to dereference a pointer and access it's
elements you need to use this syntax

```c
void move(point *p) {
  (*p).x++;
  (*p).y++;
}
```

But since this is a very common operation there is a short hand
syntax to do this same operation, accessing the element by using
the `->` (arrow) accessor

> Remember that you MUST dereference a structure pointer before
> accessing it's members

```c
void move(point *p) {
  p->x++;
  p->y++;
}
```

### Define a stucture recursively

In `c` you are allowed to use a define structure as a recursive
attribute on it's definition by passing the recursive name called
after the `struct` keyword

> The actual type you will use on the rest of the program will have
> to be named differently, usually the `_t` suffix is added to denote
> this is a typedef

```c
typedef struct node {
  int val;
  node *next;
} node_t;
```

### Assign a new struct to an array of structs

To be able to set an struct initialization to an element of an
array of the same struct you will have to explecitly cast it
to the struct type for the compiler not to complain

You can't however assigna struct pointer directly, u√±less you
firt assign the object and then get it's pointer, or mallocate
it

```c
typedef struct {
  int value;
} my_struct;

my_struct my_arr[1];
my_struct *my_arr_ptr[1];

my_arr[0] = (my_struct){.value = 2};
my_arr_ptr[0] = (my_struct *)malloc(sizeof(my_struct));

*my_arr_ptr[0] = (my_struct){.value = 3};

// Pre-allocate an array of `my_struct` with 2 elements
my_struct *my_arr_alloc = (my_struct *)malloc(sizeof(my_struct) * 2);
*my_arr_alloc[1] = (my_struct){.value = 4};

```

### Return a struct from a function

You can return a `struct` from a function withouth any problem,
howver values will be passed and copied around by value, this
may or may not be a problem depending on your needs

If all the fields of a struct are of a fixed size type, then
you may not even need to allocate anithing before returning it,
you would only need to allocate the parts that can't be known
at compile time, like for example any `pointers`

You can also return a fixed size [array](./xp8m.md) from a struct,
here is a stack overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29088462/why-you-cannot-return-fixed-size-const-array-in-c) explaining more on it

```c
struct foo {
    int array[5];
};

struct foo returns_array(void) {
    return((struct foo) {
        .array = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
    });
}
```
