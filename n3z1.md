# lang.py.module.openpyxl.cell

The standard unit of that can hold values in a workbook

## Synopsis

```py
  sheet['A1'] = 'My value'
```

## Overview

You can interact with:

- A range of cells
- A single cell
- An entire row
- An entire column

## Cookbook

### Select a a single cell

You can select a cel in two ways:

- `<column-letter><row-number>`: The name of the cell or range of cells

- `.cell()`: By scpecifying the row and column `1 index` number
  - `row`: The `1 index` number of the row
  - `column`: The `1 index` number of the columnn

```py
  sheet['A1']                   # Select the first cell
  sheet.cell(row=1, column=1)   # Select the first cell
```

### Get the values of a cell

You can use the `value` attribute of a cells object to **get** the **value
store** in the **selected cells**

```py
  sheet['A1'].value             # 'Hello World'
```

### Select a range of cells

You can select a range of cels by passing a normal `excel` **cell range
expression**

```py
  sheet['A1:B2']                # Select the first 4 cells
```

### Select an entire row or column

To select an entire row or column:

- `['<column-name>']`: The alphabetic label of the column
- `[<row-number>]`: The `1 index` number of the row

```py
  sheet['A']                    # Select the entire column 'A'
  sheet[1]                      # Select the entire row 1
```

### Select an entire range of rows or columns

You can select a range of columns or rows by passing an `excel` **cell range
epxression** with only the column labels or row numbers

```py
  sheet[1:3]                    # Select rows 1 to 3
  sheet['A:C']                  # Select columns 'A' to 'C'
```

### Move a range of cells

You can move cells around with the `move_range()` method of the worksheet
object. It will **overwrite any values** in the cells it moves them to

- `rows`: How many rows up or down to move the data
- `cols`: How many columns left or right to move the data

```py
  ws.move_range("D4:F10", rows=-1, cols=2)  # Move range one row up two columns right
```

### Add an executable formula to a cell

You can use and **evaluate formulas inside cells** by passing them with their
**english name** in **all caps** and using them **like** you would **regularly
do in** `excel`

- The **strings** inside your formula must **always** be **double quoted**
- Formulas names must be in their **all caps and in english** versions
- **Arguments** inside the formula are **coma** (`,`) **separated**

```py
  sheet['B1'] = '=SUM(A1:A3)'
```

To check the list of supported functions, insepect the `FORMULAE` constant

```py
  from openpyxl import FORMULAE

  print(FORMULAE)
```

### Merge and unmerge cells

You can merge cells together with the `merge_cells()` method of the
[sheet](./tmox.md) object

Similarly you can **unmerge cells** with the `unmerge_cells()` method

```py
  sheet.merge_cells('A1:C1')
  sheet.unmerge_cells('A1:C1')
```

### Add a filter selector to a range of cells

You can add a filter selector to be used inside the file with the
`auto_filter.ref` attribute of the sheet object

Thiw will **position** the filter at the **first row** of the **range of
cells**

```py
  sheet.auto_filter.ref = "A1:B15"
```
