# lang.js.syntax.statements

A JavaScript program is a sequence of statements. Each statement 
is an instruction for the computer to do something

## Synopsis

```js
  if (/* expression slot */) {
    // More statements here
  }
```

## Overview

A JavaScript program consists of a sequence of statements. Each statement 
is an instruction to do something, like create a [variable](./brgj.md), run an 
`if/else` [condition](./q4q3.md), or start a [loop](./s8hh.md)

Statements are the rigid structure that holds our program together, together
with [expressions]() they build the basics of writting `js` programs

Statements often have `slots` for `expressions`. We can put any **expression** 
we like into those slots.

### Many types of expression with a single statement

A `statement` has an otherwise empty expresion slot that can be filled
with any kind of `expression`

```js

  /* 
  For the following expresion:

  let hi = {{some expression}};
  */

  let hi = 1;
  let hi = "hello";
  let hi = 5 * 10;
  let hi = num > 100;
  let hi = isHappy ? "🙂" : "🙁";
  let hi = [1, 2, 3].pop();
```

### How to know if chunk of js is an statement

Want to know whether a chunk of JS is an expression or a statement? Try 
to [log](./tqv2.md) it out!

**If it runs**, the code is an `expression`. If you get an error, it's a `statement` 
(or, possibly, invalid JS). With this we can also see what the `expression`
resolves to, as it will be printed out

```js
  console.log(/* Some chunk of JS here */);
```
