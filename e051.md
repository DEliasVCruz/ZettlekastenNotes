General information about code testing

## Overview

### Unit testing vs Integration testing

- **Unit testing** test **individual isolated** aspects of a single feature

- **Integration testing** pulls and orchestrates **external resources**
  - May require more fixtures to be in place
    - Database
    - Network socket
    - Configuration file

### Structure of a test

The general structure of a test **follows**:

- **Create** your **inputs**
- **Execute** the code being tested, **capturing** the **output**
- **Compare** the output with an **expected result**

### Vocabulary

- **Fixtures**: External **data** that you create as an **input**

  - Common practice to create and resuse

- **Side effects**: When testing **alter other thigns** in the environment

  - Attributes of a **class**
  - A **file** on the filesystem
  - Value in a **database**

  - **Parameterization**: Passing **different values** to the **same test**,
    expecting the **same result**

### Suggested directory structure

Is **good practice** to have your **tests grouped** in a **different
directory** and also **separate** your **unitt tests** from your **integration
tests** into separate folders.

Is also a good idea to **keep** any **fixtures** that will **mock external
data** in it's **onw folder** to later import and setup

**In this example** we apply this principle in a `Python` **project**

```sh
  project/
  │
  ├── my_app/
  │   └── __init__.py
  │
  └── tests/
      |
      └── unit/
      |   ├── __init__.py
      |   └── test_sum.py
      |
      └── integration/
          |
          ├── fixtures/
          |   ├── test_basic.json
          |   └── test_complex.json
          |
          ├── __init__.py
          └── test_integration.py
```

### Testing with remote resources

If your test suits needs to **operate on** a remote resource such as a **remote
API**.

It is **best practice** to **store remote fixtures locally** so they can be
recalled and sent to the application

### When to use and when not to use fixtures

- When to **use a fixture**:

  - You could **use a fixture if** you find yourself **writing** several **tests**
    that all make **use** of the **same** underlying **test data**

  - If you **need** some **data** that **remains constant, relevant and representative**
    across different tests

  - Yuu need to **initialize some system resource**

- When not to use a fixture:

  - If your input requires variations across different tests
  - Polluting your test suite with many slightly different fixtures is no good
