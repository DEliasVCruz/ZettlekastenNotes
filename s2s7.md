# lang.py.module.pandas.grouping.aggregation

Complex aggreagation of groups of data with index as groups

## Synopsis

```py
  [ser|df].groupby(<group>).agg(<agregation>)
```

## Overview

When using `agg` to perform aggregation on your group sets, the **result** will
**reflect** [indexing](./271q.md) **based on the groups**

- Use this if you want your **groups** to **become the new index**
- Works on a [Series](./mkgv.md) basis

## Cookbook

### Use more than one aggregation function

You can use more than one aggregation function on **more than one column** with
`agg`. It comes in the form of a [dictionary](./0loj.md) where:

- **keys**: The column name
- **values**: Calable functions
  - It can have **more than one function** in the form of a [list](./7cxo.md)
  - This is usefull if you want to use the different functions on the same column

```py
  tips.groupby('day').agg({'tip': np.mean, 'day': np.size}
```

This is all **similar to** the following `sql` query

```sql
  SELECT day, AVG(tip), COUNT(day)
  FROM tips
  GROUP BY day;
```

It can also accept a single [list](./7cxo.md) in which case it will apply evry
one of the agregation functions to each selected column

```py
  tips.groupby('day')['tip'].agg(["mean", "count"])
```

### Use aggregation when grouping on more than one column

You can have **more than one aggregation** function on **more than one column**
at the same time after a group by operation

```py
  df.groupby('Gender')['Height', 'Weight'].agg(['mean', 'median'])
```

### Apply a custom aggregation function

You can difine custom aggregation functions with the `agg()` method since it
can also take a [lambda](./8uan.md) function as the aggregation function that
takes only one parameter as the [Series](./mkgv.md) object

```py
  df.groupby("outlet", sort=False)["title"].agg(
      lambda ser: ser.str.contains("Fed").sum()
  ).nlargest(10)
```
