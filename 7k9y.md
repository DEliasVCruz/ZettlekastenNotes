The Microsoft authentication library for python

## Synopsis

```py
  from msal import PublicClientApplication

  app = PublicClientApplication(<client-id>, authority=<authority>[, token_cache=<token-cache>])
```

## Overview

You can use the msal library to streamline the authentication and authorization flows
for scripts and applications to get acccess to the MSGraph API

It does so by impolementing the OAuth2 and OpenID protocols for authorization and
authentication respectively

It supports the following authentication flows:

- `OAuth 2.0 auth code grant`
- `OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant`
- `OAuth 2.0 device code flow`

- [Supported auth flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows)

  - Here is a step by step on the rest api calls to authenticate throught flows

## Cookbook

### Create a public client application

To start an authentication process you first need to get an instance of a
`ClientApplication`. This only needs be created once per client application

- There are two types of applications:
  - `PublicClientApplication`: For apps that may live in user enviorments
  - `ConfidentialClientApplication`: For apps that live in secure environments

Some of the parameters that it accepts are:

- `client_id`: The id of the register app in AzureAD Identity Manager
- `authority`: The login url
  - It will start with `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`
  - It will end with either:
    - `common`: If you app is registered to be used with all types of accunts
    - `consumers`: If your app can only be used by personal accounts
    - `tenant_name|tenant_id`: If your app can only be used by profesional accounts
- `token_cache`: This has to be given by an instance of `TokenCache`
- `http_client`: By default it will use an instance of the `requests.Session()` class
  - You can provide your own instance of an http client (don't work with async client)

```py
  from msal import PublicClientApplication

  client_id = "<my-client-id>"
  authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers"

  app = PublicClientApplication(client_id, authority=authority, token_cache=cache)
```

### Use the interactive auth code grant flow

In this flow you first construct an authentication url that the user will be required
to access and authenticate as.

- This will be done with the `.initiate_auth_code_flow()` method of your app
  - Returns a [dictionary](./0loj.md) that needs to be passed to `.acquire_token_by_auth_code_flow()`
  - From that dictionary you can retrieve the generated `auth_uri`
  - Some of the parameters it accepts are:
    - `scopes`: A [list](./7cxo.md) of [strings](./4t3v.md) defining the permission the app needs concent for
    - `redirect_uri`: The specified path where the code will be sent to (must be registered)
      - It will most commonly be `http[s]://[my_app|localhost][port|/endpoint]`
    - `prompt`: A string with the type of interaction the user is gonna have to authenticate
      - Usually `login` is enough
    - `response_mode`: Wheter to use
      - `query`: The standard `GET` request with the code in the query parameters
      - `form_post`: A `POST` request with the code inside the payload

```py
  scopes = ["Files.Read", "Files.Read.All", "Files.ReadWrite", "Files.ReadWrite.All"]
  redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8000"

  result = None

  if not result:
    flow = app.initiate_auth_code_flow(
        scopes=scopes,
        redirect_uri=redirect_uri,
        prompt="login",
    )

  print("Please enter this url in a browser and follow the steps")
  print(flow["auth_uri"])
```

After the users is done authenticating, it will be redirected to the `redirect_uri` as a
`GET` request with the authentication `code` and other relevant data inside the query
parameters (if the `response_mode="query"` was used)

- This can be capture by either:
  - Setting up and endpoint in your server
  - Rolling up an ephimeral [sockets]() server that listens for this request
  - Either way it should be listening at the specified `redirect_uri` endpoint
- Once the request is recived you need to capture its parameters as a dictionary
  to then pass it to `.acquire_token_by_auth_code_flow()` too

```py
  import socket

  if not result:

      (...) # First step of getting auth_uri

      server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
      server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
      server_socket.bind((SERVER_HOST, SERVER_PORT))
      server_socket.listen(1)
      print("Listening on port %s ..." % SERVER_PORT)

      query_dict = {}
      while not query_dict:
          client_connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()
          request = client_connection.recv(1024).decode()

          headers = request.split("\n")
          path = headers[0].split()[1]

          query_components = parse_qs(urlparse(path).query)
          query_dict = {key: value[0] for key, value in query_components.items()}

          message = "Esta pagina se uso solo para autenticar y ya puedes cerrarla"
          response = f"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n{message}"
          client_connection.sendall(response.encode())
          client_connection.close()

      server_socket.close()
      print("Closed server")
      print(query_dict)
```

Once you've got your authentication response you need to pass it,
alongside the dictionary returned by `.initiate_auth_code_flow()` to the
`.acquire_token_by_auth_code_flow()` method of your app

- This takes some of the following arguments
  - `auth_code_flow`: The same dict returned by `.initiate_auth_code_flow()`
  - `auth_response`: The dict version of the parameters given by the `redirect_uri`
  - `scopes`: The same, or a subset of, scopes you passeed to `.initiate_auth_code_flow()`

This will finnally return a dictionary containing the `access_token` key. In case it
does not contain this key, then it means something failed and it will return a
dictionary with the errors

```py
  import request
  import json

  if not result:

      (...) # First step of getting auth_uri

      (...) # Second part of getting params query dict with websocket

      result = app.acquire_token_by_auth_code_flow(flow, query_dict, scopes=scopes)

  graph_data = ""

  if "access_token" in result:
      graph_data = requests.get(
          f"{main_uri}{endpoint}",
          headers={
              "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
              "Accept": "application/json",
              "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
      ).json()
  else:
      raise ValueError(f"Fail to get access token. Err: {json.dumps(result, indent=2)}")

  print(json.dumps(graph_data, indent=2))
```

### Silently get access tokens without user interaction

If your user has already authenticate it self at some point in an interactive
way, and you maintain a cache of this authorization tokens. Then you can use
the `.get_accounts()` and `acquire_token_silent()` methods of your app.

This will respectively:
  - Check the cach for any previous authentication by a given user
  - Get the a valid token from the cache or generate a new one with the
    refresh token for the users token

This way the user won't have to go through the interactive authentication steps
every time it needs to get a token

```py
  result = None

  accounts = app.get_accounts()
  if accounts:
      for account in accounts:
          if account["name"] == <searched_user_name>:
              selected_account = account

      account = selected_account
      result = app.acquire_token_silent(scopes=scopes, account=account)
```

### Create a confidential client application

For apps that are to be used as daemons and have their own client secrets
to authenticate and thus don't need user interaction

- This apps can use the `client credentials grant` flow
- You can use the `client_credential` parameter to pass the client secret credentials
- You would then get an access token with the `acquire_token_for_client()` method

```py
  from msla import ConfidentialClientApplication

  app = ConfidentialClientApplication(client_id, client_credential, authority=authority)
  acces_token = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=["Files.ReadWrite", "Files.ReadWrite.All"])
```

### Create a serialized cache for your token

When creating an instance of a `ClientApplication`, be it public or confidential,
you can pass an instance of `TokenCache` to serialize and deserialized a cache
of the authorization token so that it may be used again withouth needing the
user to re-authenticate

- You then must pass this instance to the `token_cache` parameter of the
  `ClientApplication` class

```py
  import atexit
  from pathlib import Path
  from msal import PublicClientApplication, SerializableTokenCache

  cache = SerializableTokenCache()

  cache_file = Path().home().joinpath("my_cache.bin")

  if cache_file.exists():
      cache.deserialize(cache_file.open("r").read())

  atexit.register(
      lambda: cache_file.open("w").write(cache.serialize())
      if cache.has_state_changed
      else None
  )

  app = PublicClientApplication(app_id, authority=authority, token_cache=cache)
```
