# lang.psql.select

To read rows and data from your database tables

## Synopsis

```sql
  SELECT [COMMNAD] <column-name> [AS <column-name>]
  FROM <table-name> [AS <table-alias>] [COMMANDS];'
```

## Overview

One of the main SQL operations is to read and **query** data. To do so we use
the `SELECt` command to specify what we want to grab and `FROM` to know from
what table to grab the values

### Commands

- `FROM`: **What table** to select the fields from
- `DISTINCT`: **Only** grab **non repeated** records
- `WHERE`: Perform **conditional filtering**
- `LIMIT`: Limit the number of records that are returned
- `OFFSET`: What **row to start selecting** from
- `ORDER BY`: **Sort** on ascending or descending order
- `GROUP BY`: **Groups** rows that have the **same values into summary rows**
- `AS`: **Change** a **column** display **name**
- `UNION`: **Combine** the **results** of **multiple queries**
- `INTERSECT`: **List** of the **values** that are **in both queries**
- `EXCEPT`: **List** of the **values** that are **not in both queries**

### Globs

You can use some globs inside your data query

- `*`: Select every single column from an specified table

## Cookbook

### Select some columns

To **select and view** specified **fields**:

```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person;
```

### Select every column in a table

This is how you perform a **basic read operation**

```sql
  SELECT * FROM <table-name>;
```

### Change the column name of a field

**By default** if you don't specify a column name, it will **use either**:

- The **function name**
- The **field name**
- `?colum?` as an undefined

To **give a column a especial** name you can use the `AS` command to give a
display name

```sql
  SELECT brand, model,
  ROUND(price - (price * .10), 2) AS discounted_price
  FROM car;
```

### Reference a table by an alias

You can **abbreviate the name of your tables** when [combining](./qjl9.md)
columns from different tables **with aliases**, so you don't have to be
repeating

```sql
  SELECT b.base_id, s.supply_id, s.name
  FROM base AS b
  JOIN supply AS s;
```

### Select only unique records in a field

If you want to view only the non repeated elements in a columns you can use the
`DISTINCT` command.

```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT <column-name> FROM <table-name>;
```

### Only recover a limited amount of records

If you only want to **display only a certain amount of results** you can use
the `LIMIT` command

You can also specified an **offset** for **what row** the limit **starts
grabbing from** with the `OFFSET` command

```sql
  SELECT * FROM person OFFSET <row-number> LIMIT <row-number>;
```

### Handle empty records

**If you don't give** a [constrain](./q09z.md) to the records in a field. When
queering this fields you **might** find yourself **with empty values**.

To **replace** this empty values **with some default value** you can use the
`COALESCE()` function

```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(email, "No email given") FROM person;
```

### Display summary of repeated values

You can use the `GROUP BY` command to [group](./6mxs.md) **repeated values into
summary rows**

It is often used with **aggregation** [functions](./x41v.md), to **group** the
result set into **one or more columns**

- `COUNT()`
- `MAX()`
- `MIN()`
- `SUM()`
- `AVG()`

```sql
  SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers
  GROUP BY Country;
```

### Perform arithmetic on a column records

If you want to perform some **arithmetic operation on the values of the
records** in a field, you can do so with arithmetic operators (`*`, `+`, `/`,
etc).

By **default** this will be **displayed in an extra unnamed column** and
**not directly** on the original column

```sql
  SELECT id, brand, model, price,
  ROUND(price * .10, 2), ROUND(price - (price * 0.1), 2)
  FROM car;
```

### Combine the results of different queries

This will **combine the results of** different `SELECT` **queries** with the
`UNION` command.

The **values** of the columns **don't need to match**, but the **number of
columns** and **datya type do**

```sql
  SELECT country FROM customers
  UNION
  SELECT region FROM employees;
```

### Combine the intersection of values in different queries

You can **display the intersecting results** (same values) of different queries
with the `INTERSECT` command.

**By default** this will display only the **distinct values**, if you want to
**display also the repeated values** you can use `INTERSECT ALL`

```sql
  SELECT country FROM customers
  INTERESECT [ALL]
  SELECT country FROM suppliers;
```

### Combine the values from different queries that don't match

If you want only the **values** that **are not the same** in different queries
use the `EXCEPT` command

```sql
  SELECT country FROM customers
  EXCEPT [ALL]
  SELECT country FROM suppliers;
```

### Perform nested queries

You can **perform sub queries** to fill columns in another queries by
**embeding** them **like an other selected column** with `()`

```sql
  SELECT b.base_id, s.supply_id, s.name,
      (SELECT quantitiy FROM inventory
       WHERE base_id = b.base_id AND supply_id = s.supply_id)
  FROM base AS b
  JOIN supply AS s;
```

### Sort the selected fields

You can [sort](./lhgd.md) in descending or ascending order with the `ORDER BY`
command

### Filter based on conditions

You can [filter](./m2xg.md) data that satisfies a condition with the `WHERE` command
