### Install pyenv

You first need to install the dependencies for your plataform. In the case of
`Arch` linux. Or visit the [wiki](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment)

```sh
  pacman -S --needed base-devel openssl zlib xz
```

To install pyenv use the installer

```sh
  curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

### List and install new python versions

You can use the `install` comand to **list** and **install** python versions

```sh
  pyenv install --list      # List all available versions
```

To **list a specific version** of python that you are looking for use `grep`.

In this example we use it to **find** what available **versions** of python
**between 3.6 and 3.8**

```py
  pyenv install --list | grep " 3\.[678]"
```

Once you've found the version you want install it with the `-v` flag

```sh
  pyenv install -v 3.8.2
```

### Unistall a version of python

You can uninstall a version of python by:

- Going to the instalation directory and removing the corresponding directory
- Using the `unistall` comand

```sh
  pyenv unistall 3.8.2
```

### Set a python version to use

If you want to **use a python version** you can **set it globaly** by usign the
`global` comand

```sh
  pyenv global 3.8.2
```

You can set a **local project python version** with the `local` comand

```sh
  pyenv local 3.8.2
```

### Go back to the system version

If you want to go back to the system version of python

```sh
  pyenv global system
```
