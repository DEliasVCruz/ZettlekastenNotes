# cli.git.restore

If you want to **bring back a deleted file** or **bring it back to it's
previously unmodified state**

## Overview

You can use this if you want to **remove unstage changes** and unlike `reset`
this **will not move you back to whole ohter commit**.

A simillar effect can be achieved with the [checkout](./it3j.md) command, but
restore was created as a **dedicated command** for this operation. Since
functionally `checkout` con achive the same result

## Cookbook

### Restore a deleted file

If you want to **bring back a file that you previously delted**. This base
version only works on a **file that was delted on the current commit**

```sh
  git checkout <deletedfile>
```

### Restore a previous version of a file (from a previous commit)

If you want to **restore a file/files to the way it was in a previous commit**.
This will **mark the file as moddified** and you will have to make a new commit
to make it effective

```sh
  git checkout <commitid> <file>
```

### Restore file to unmodified state (revert unstaged changes)

You could restore a file to **how it was before it was modified**, bring
it back to the version in the current commit

```sh
  git restore <file>
```

### Fix a commit

You should use [reset](./z9bi.md)
