# cli.git.restore

If you want to **bring back a deleted file** or **bring it back to it's
previously unmodified state**

## Overview

You can use this if you want to **remove unstage changes** and unlike `reset`
this **will not move you back to whole ohter commit**.

A simillar effect can be achieved with the [checkout](./it3j.md) command, but
restore was created as a **dedicated command** for this operation. Since
functionally `checkout` con achive the same result

## Cookbook

### How to unstage a file

You can `unstage` a file and **undo an** [add](./r03e.md) operation with the
`restore` command alonside the `--staged` flag option

- The equivalent reverse operation of `git add`
- This will revome the files from the staging area

> There is other ways to achive this, but this is the recommended way

```sh
git restore --staged <file-to-unstage>
```

### Restore a deleted file

If you want to **bring back a file that you previously delted**. This base
version only works on a **file that was delted on the current commit**

```sh
  git checkout <deletedfile>
```

### Restore a previous version of a file (from a previous commit)

If you want to **restore a file/files to the way it was in a previous commit**.
This will **mark the file as moddified** and you will have to make a new commit
to make it effective

```sh
  git checkout <commitid> <file>
```

### Restore file to unmodified state (remove all unstaged changes)

You could restore a file to **how it was before it was modified**, to bring
it back to it's version in the current commit

```sh
  git restore <file>
```

### Fix a commit

You should use [reset](./z9bi.md)

```sh
  git checkout <branchname> # Move to the branch you want to reset
  git reset <commitid> # Make the branch point to a different commit
```
