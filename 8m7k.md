If you want to **bring back a file that you previously delted**. This base
version only works on a **file that was delted on the current commit**

```sh
  git checkout <deletedfile>
```

### Restore a previous version of a file (from a previous commit)

If you want to **restore a file/files to the way it was in a previous commit**.

to make it effective

```sh
  git checkout <commitid> <file>
```
