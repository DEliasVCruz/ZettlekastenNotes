## Cookbook

### Restore a deleted file

If you want to **bring back a file that you previously delted**. This base
version only works on a **file that was delted on the current commit**

```sh
  git checkout <deletedfile>
```

### Restore a previous version of a file (from a previous commit)

If you want to **restore a file/files to the way it was in a previous commit**.
This will **mark the file as moddified** and you will have to make a new commit
to make it effective

```sh
  git checkout <commitid> <file>
```

### Restore file to unmodified state (revert unstaged changes)

You could restore a file to **how it was before it was modified**, bring
it back to the version in the current commit

```sh
  git restore <file>
```

### Fix a commit

You should use [reset](./z9bi.md)
