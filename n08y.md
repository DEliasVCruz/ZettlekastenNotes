# lang.bash.type.string

In bash everything is a string

## Overview

An **entire command** can be **considered a string**, when we are dealing with
[commands](./rffs.md), [data](./800e.md) and [variables](./y2lh.md) we need to
**be sure everything** that needs to be separated **is separated properly**,
and everything that needs to stay together **stays together properly**.

## Cookbook

### How to concatenate strings

For this you can use [variables](./y2lh.md), **refer to it's note** for more
information

Though in **Bash 3.1** you can use the `+=` for appending:

**EXTREMELY non-portable!**

```bash
  string+=" more data here"
```

### Find the length of a string

To find the length of a string, just **prefix** it with a `#`. Then you can
perform [variable expasion](./2zqa.md) as usual

```bash
  loacl str="Hello, World!"
  local length_of_word=$(#sp)
```

### Split a string based on a delimiter

You can split a string based on a delimiter to **form an array of it's
elements**, by using the `IFS` variable.

The `IFS` **internal variable** is used to **assign the delimiter** for
**dividing a string**

Then use the `read` command to **turn the input** into an array with the **array
definition** flag `-a`. The `-r` flag makes **backslashes literal** and **not
scape characters**

```bash
  IFS=' '
  read -ra <array_name> <<< <input>
```

### Uppercase a string

To upper case a string you just **append**:

- `^`: **Capitalization**, only upper case the first character in the string
- `^^`: **Uppercase**: the **whole word** will be in uppercase

```bash
  name="daniel"
  echo $name        # daniel
  echo "${name^}"   # Daniel
  echo "${name^^}"  # DANIEL
```

### Lowercase a string

To lower case a string you just **append**:

- `,`: Lowercase **first character** of the string
- `,,`: Lowercase **the whole string**

```bash
  name="DANIEL"
  echo $name        # DANIEL
  echo "${name,}"   # dANIEL
  echo "${name,,}"  # daniel
```

### Test if the string is matched by a regex

With the `=~` operator you can test against a regex Rember that this **passes**
if the regex **matches something** on the string

```bash
  [[ "$string" =~ regex ]]
```
