### Perform rolling window operations

Sometimes you may want to perform operations were you **operate on a set of
values in a window** and this window **moves as we traverse the elements** in
our series

You can do this with the `rolling()` method that **creates a fixed size window**
that moves across by each element in your `Series`

**At the beginning only the end of the window** will be positioned on the first
value and more of it will be moving inside the `Series` accordingly

It will **not perform operations unless it has all values** that **correspond
to** the **size** of the **window**. You **can specify** a number of **minimum
values** it needs with the `min_periods` argument

```py
  df = pd.DataFrame({'B': [0, 1, 2, np.nan, 4]})
  df.rolling(window=2, min_periods=1).sum()         # Operate with at least one value
```
