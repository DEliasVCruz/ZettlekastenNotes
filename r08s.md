# lang.py.module.pandas.operations.window.rolling

Perform operations on a moving fixed range of values

## Synopsis

```py
  [ser|df].rolling(<window>, <min_periods>).<operation>()
```

## Overview

Sometimes you may want to perform operations were you **operate on a set of
values in a window** and this window **moves as we traverse the elements** in
our series

You can do this with the `rolling()` method that **creates a fixed size window**
that moves across by each element in your `Series`

**At the beginning only the end of the window** will be positioned on the first
value and more of it will be moving inside the `Series` accordingly

- For **more on window operations** check the [window user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/window.html)

## Cookbook

### Perform rolling window operations

It will **not perform operations unless it has all values** that **correspond
to** the **size** of the **window**.

- `min_periods`: **Specify** a number of **minimum values** it needs to operate
- `axis='columns`: You can use the parameter to **do it row-wise**
- `center`: If `True` result will be assigned to the center of the window element
- `closeds`: Defaults to `None` and can be either:
  - `left`: **First point** of the window is **excluded from calculations**
  - `right`: **Last point** of the window is **excluded from calculations**
  - `neither`: Not the first nor the last point are included

```py
  df = pd.DataFrame({'B': [0, 1, 2, np.nan, 4]})
  df.rolling(window=2, min_periods=1).sum()         # Operate with at least one value
```

### Operate with a time series window

If your [index](./271q.md) is a [time series](./6e6x.md) index you can specify
the window shape as periods of time

```py
  df_time.rolling('2s').sum()
```

### Calculate the difference between rows

You can use the `pandas` api to perform the **common operation** of calulating
the **difference of a row element with it's previous row element** with the
`diff()` method

```py
  df := pd.DataFrame([[1,2], [2, 3]])

# 0     1 2
# 1     2 3

  df.diff()

# 0     NaN NanN
# 1     1   1
```
