Make your classes more fast and efficient with slots

## Synopsis

```py
  class <clas-name>:
      __slots__ = [<atribute-names>]
```

## Overview

A `slot` is a type of `magic attribute` that let's you **define** your class
**attributes** in such a way that it will **make** your **classes faster** and
use **less memory**

- You **can** still define **class variables**

- There are **some restrictions** for classes that use `slots`:

  - Attributes **not present** in `__slots__` may **not be defined**
  - A `slots` class can **not** have **default values**

- Some of the **benefits** are:

  - The `slots` classes take up **less memory**
  - They are **faster** to work with

## Cookbook

### Create a slots class

To turn your class into a `slots` class you need to **specify all** of your
**class attributes** as an [iterable](././p7q9.md) of [stings](./4t3v.md), like
a [list](./7cxo.md), passed to the `__slots__` **magic attribute**

```py
  class Person():
      __slots__ = ('name', 'age')

      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
```

### Inherit from a slots class

You can inherit from a `slots` class and the child class won't be a `slots`
class, but it will **still inherit** all the **attributes and methods** like a normal
child class.

- You can still define extra `slots` for your child class

```py
  class Developer():
      __slots__ = ['name', 'age']

  class Develop(Developer):
      __slots__ = ['salary']
```
