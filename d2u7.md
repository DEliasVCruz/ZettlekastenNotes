# lang.py.module.excel.openpyxl.format.conditional

Apply conditional formatting to cells

## Synopsis

```py
  from openpyxl.styles.differential import DifferentialStyle
  from openpyxl.formatting.rule import Rule,

  diferential_style = DifferentialStyle()
  rule = Rule(<type>, diferential_style)

  sheet.conditional_formatting.add(<range>, rule)
```

## Overview

You can add conditional formatting to a range of cell based on different
conditions like you would in a normal `excel` file

By default you can use **three built-in conditional formats** for **ease of
use**:

- `ColorScale`: Create conditional formatting based on a **changing scale of colors**
- `IconSet`: Create conditional formatting that will **display icons**
- `DataBar`: Create a **color bar gradient** inside the cell **based on greater value**

To **create** the **rule style** you need to use the `DifferentialStyle()` class

## Cookbook

## Create conditional formatting based on a cell expression

You can create conditional formatting for a range of cell **based on the
evaluated expression on another range of cells**

This works as the **custom condition** option when creating conditional
formatting normally in `excel`

- Create your custom style with the `DifferentialStyle()` class

- Create a `Rule()` class instance
  - The `type` will be `'expression'`
  - The style will be passed to `dxf`

- Create the formula that will be evaluated as a [list](./7cxo.md) element
  - Pass the formula as to the `formula` attribute of the `Rule()` instance

- Apply the conditional formatting with `condtional_formatting.add()`
  - This is a method of the [sheet](./tmox.md) object
  - The **first argument** is the **range to apply** the format to
  - The **second argument** is the `Rule()` instance

```py
  from openpyxl.styles import PatternFill
  from openpyxl.styles.differential import DifferentialStyle
  from openpyxl.formatting.rule import Rule

  red_background = PatternFill(fgColor="00FF0000")
  diff_style = DifferentialStyle(fill=red_background)

  rule = Rule(type="expression", dxf=diff_style)
  rule.formula = ["$H1<3"]

  sheet.conditional_formatting.add("A1:O100", rule)
```

### Create conditional formatting with icons

You can use the `IconSetRule()` class rule to easily create conditional
formatting that displays icons on the cell

You can **choose** from the following **set of icons**:

- `[3,4,5]Arrows[Grey]`
- `3Flags`
- `3TrafficLigths[1,2]`
- `3Signs`
- `[4,5]Rating`

```py
  from openpyxl.formatting.rule import IconSetRule

  icon_rule = IconSetRule(icon_style='3TrafficLights1',
                          type='formula',)

  sheet.conditional_formatting.add("A1:O100", icon_rule)
```
