# lang.py.module.numpy.vectorize

Converts a normal python function into a vectorized one

## Synopsis

```py
import numpy as np

np.vectorize([<pyfunc>], [<otypes>], [<excluded>])
```

## Overview

This is a function that will take a Python function and 
turn it into a NumPy ufunc, so it can handle vectorized 
approaches. It vectorizes your function, not necessarily 
how that function applies to your data

> If the `pyfunc` argument is ommited it will produce
> a decorator with keyword arguments

### Parameters

- `pyfunc`(_optional_): The function to be vectorized
- `otypes`(_optional_): The `str` or `list` of output `dtypes`
- `excluded`(_optional_): Set of `str` of arguments not to 
  be vectorized they will be passed directly to the `pyfunc`

### Turn a function into one that can handle vectorization

When trying to do efficent **data science** you will find
out that doing `vectorized` operations is much more efficent
than doing traditional `for loops` or, in the case of [pandas](./czyt.md),
using [apply](./slpd.md)

But you will soon realize that this functions may not work
with passing them [columns](./6j2u.md) or [rows](./myvh.md) and may get
a `ValueError`

Consider this function:

```py
def compare_func(col1, col2):
    if col1 == '- None -':
        return col2
    else:
        return col1

# This will not work with `ValueError` error thrown
df['Status'] = compare_func(df['Status at Time of Lead'], df['Current Status'])
```

It gets fails since it does not now how to use the `==`
opeartor on the two column [series](./mkgv.md) 

You can use the `vectorized` method to make it be able
to handle `vector` arguments such as this `series columns`

```py
 # with the np.vectorize method --> returns a vectorized callable
vectfunc = np.vectorize(compare_func) #otypes=[np.float],cache=False)

# This will now work correctly
df['Status'] = vectfunc(df['Status at Time of Lead'], df['Current Status'])
```
