# lang.py.module.numpy.filtering

Filter your numpy arrays

## Synopsis

```py
  import numpy as np

  vector = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
  vector[<index>[,<other-dimensions-index>]]
  vector[<mask>]
```

## Overview

You can filter your array **either by**:

- Index slicing: it supports the **similar slicing as** a [string](./4t3v.md) but
  for **each** [axis](./bd42.md) **dimension**

- Filtering with a **mask** array

## Cookbook

### Filter with index slicing

You can use the same **slicing methods as** you do for `strings` but you can do
so **for each dimmension in order**, separating them by a comma (`,`)

- This indices are `zero-based` and **open on the end point**

```py
  import numpy as np

  square = np.array([
      [16, 3, 2, 13],
      [5, 10, 11, 8],
      [9, 6, 7, 12],
      [4, 15, 14, 1]
  ])

  square[:, 1].sum()        # 34
  square[:2, :2].sum()      # 34
  square[2:, :2].sum()      # 34
  square[:2, 2:].sum()      # 34
```

### Filter by an array mask

You can **pass another array** with the **same shape** as your array you are
about to filter **but with** [boolean](./6auy.md) values

You can **combine multiple expression** in your filter index with **logic
operators**:

- `~`: The **NOT** logic operator for **negation**
- `&`: The **AND** logic operation for **conjuction**
- `|`: The **OR** logic operation for **at least one true**
- `^`: The **XOR** logic operation for **both true or both false**

- There the **ones that align** `False` will be **filter out**

```py
  numbers = np.array([[ 5, 6,  8, 10, 12, 14],
                     [16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26],
                     [28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38],
                     [40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50]])

  mask = numbers % 4 == 0             # This is broadcasting the boolean operation
  numbers[mask]

# Out: array([ 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48])

  numbers[numbers % 4 == 0]           # Doing it directly

# Out: array([ 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48])
```
