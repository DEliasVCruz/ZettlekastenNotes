# lang.py.module.numpy.array.axis

A zero-based index method of referencing the dimensions of an array

## Synopsis

```py
  <array>.<operation>(axis=<int>)
```

## Overview

An [array](./fgdd.md) can have multiple dimentions and axes are `zero-indexed`
way to identify which dimension is which

Lots of [functions](./doyy.md) and commands in `NumPy` **change** their
**behavior based on** which **axis** you tell them to process

- By defualt **most** operations will be **done on the entire array**
- You can **specify an specific axis** to operate on

## Cookbook

### Perform an operation on individual access

In this example, we can see that by **default** the `max()` routine will get the
**max** value from the **entire dataset**

You can specify to **only get** the **maximum** of the **rows** (`axis=0`) or
the **columns** (`axis=1`)

```py
  import numpy as np

  table = np.array([
      [5, 3, 7, 1],
      [2, 6, 7 ,9],
      [1, 1, 1, 1],
      [4, 3, 2, 0],
  ])

  table.max()
# Out: 9

  table.max(axis=0)
# Out: array([5, 6, 7, 9])

  table.max(axis=1)
# Out: array([7, 9, 1, 4])
```
