# cli.npm.audit

Review security concerns on your installed packages

## Synopsis

```sh
npm audit [options]
```

## Overview

It scans your installed packaged dependencies for any vulnerabilities
and gives you a report of the affected packages, dependencies, their
vulnerability level and if it's solvable with a version update

### Options

- `fix`: The sub-command to automatically fix security issues
  - `--force`: Force `npm` to installed dependencies that might be conflicting
    or introduce breaking changes

## Cookbook

### Fix all package vulnerabilities

You can solve all your vulnerable packages and update other dependent packages
accordingly with the `fix` sub-command

- It optionally accepts the `--force` flag to force fixes with potential breaking
  changes or conflicting versions

```sh
npm audit fix [--force]
``` 

### Fix individual vulnerabilities

Under the hood what the `audit fix` command is doing is, just [updating](./lkvs.md) your
vulnerable dependencies to a version that is safe and updating other
packages that may need to resolve to the new version

You can do this you self by manually calling `update` on your vulnerable package
to a safe verison, and other packages that may now need their dependecies update
to new version of the package as well

```sh
npm update <vulnerable-package-name>
```
