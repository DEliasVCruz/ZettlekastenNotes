# cli.paru

An AUR helper similar to yay

## Synopsis

```sh
  paru [options] [packages]
```

## Overview

This is an `AUR` helper to download packages, like `yay` that has been
**re-written in** `rust` and adds more customization and new features

Most options that already work with [pacman](./upki.md) and `yay` work with
`paru` as well

### Options

- `-S`: Install packages or intercat with repos
- `-Q`: Perform a query of installed packages
- `-u`: Perform an update of packages
- `-y`: Perform an update of the repos
- `-a`: Perform option only for `AUR` repos
- `-s`: Search

## Cookbook

### Install packages from the standard repos

In essence `paru` is a wrapper around the `pacman` command and so it can do all
that pacman can

```sh
  paru -S <package>
```

### Search for a package

You can add the `-s` option to search for a package

```sh
  paru -Ssa <aur-package>
```

### Open the application files in a file manager

If you want to **inspect or edit** all the files that will be installed with the
application, including the `pkgbuild` file, you can do so by **passing** your **file
manager of choice** to the `--fm` option

- Additionally you can provide the `--fmflags` to pass options to your file manager

You can **configure** this **to be the default** with the `FileManager` option

```sh
  paru -S <package> --fm <file-manager-name> [--fmflags]
```

### Update only AUR packages

To update only the packages installed from the `AUR` then you can run the
`-Sua --upgrademenu` option

- This will let you select if you want to update all or select which

You can **configure** this to **be the default** in the config file with the
`UpgradeMenu` option

```sh
  paru -Sua --upgrademenu
```

### Find what AUR packages only are installed

If you want to list only the packages that have been installed from the aur you
can pas the `-Qua` option

```sh
  paru -Qua
```
