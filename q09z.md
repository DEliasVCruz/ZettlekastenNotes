# lang.psql.constrains

Extra specifications for the type of data that will populate the tables in the
database

## Synopsis

```sql
  (
      <column-name> <DATA-TYPE> [CONSTRAINTS]
  );
```

## Overview

If any of the constrains is not met, the row that has the failure constrain
will not be added

### Commands

- `DROP CONSTRAINT`: **Remove a constrain** from a field

### Conditions

- `NOT NULL`: The column **can't contain empty values**
- `UNIQUE`: **Ensure** that the same **value is not repeated**
- `CHECK`: Add a **constraint based on a boolean** condition

## Cookbook

### Add a constraint after defining a table

You can define constraints after the [table](./rolo.md) was already created. **If
no** `<constraint-name>` is given, **it will be automatically given a name**

```sql
  ALTER TABLE <table-name>
  ADD CONSTRAINT [<constraint-name>] <CONSTRAINT-COMMAND> (<columns>);
```

### Remove a constrain after defining a table

You can **remove a constrain** with the `DROP` command

```sql
  ALTER TABLE <table-name> DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint-name>;
```

### Create a column that can't be empty

If you **want** one of your columns to **ensure** that it **dosen't contain
empty records**

```sql
  CREATE TABLE person (
    id BIGSERIAL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  );
```

### Create a columns that can't have repeated values

If you **want each value in the field to be unique**, meaning that is not repeated,
you can use the `UNIQUE` constrain

- At the **table definition**:

```sql
  CREATE TABLE person (
      id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      email VARCHAR(70) UNIQUE
  )
```

- As a **function**:

```sql
  CREATE TABLE person (
      id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      email VARCHAR(70),
      UNIQUE(email)
  );
```

- **After** the **table was created** by altering it:

This only works **if there is not any duplicated value already**

```sql
  ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAIN <constrain-name> UNIQUE (<columns>);
```

### Create a column that only accepts values that pass a test

If you want to restrict **values that satisfy a conditional test**, you can do so
with the `CHECK` constraint

The following example will **ensure that** the `gender` column can only be "Female"
or "Male"

```sql
  ALTER TABLE person
  ADD CONSTRAINT [<constraint-name>]
  CHECK (gender = "Female" OR gender = "Male");
```
