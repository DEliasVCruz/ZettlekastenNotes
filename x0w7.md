# lang.py.module.numpy.operations

General operations as methods of an array

## Synopsis

```py
  <array>.<operation>([<axis>])
```

## Overview

This operations will **commonly perform** some type of
**aggregation/reduction** of our data

- `.sum()`: Calculate the **sum** of all the elements in the array
- `.std()`: Calculate the **standard deviation** of the elements
- `.max()`: Calculate the **max value** of the elements
- `.mean()`: Calculate the **mean value** of the elements

## Cookbook

### Perform the operation on an specific dimension axis

Thou most of this operations take into account all the dimensions and elements
from the array to perform their calculations.

You can pass the `axis=<axis-index>` argument to denote an specific axis
dimension to do the operation on

```py
  data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

  data.sum(axis=0)                      # array([4, 6])
  data.sum(axis=1)                      # array([3, 7])
```
