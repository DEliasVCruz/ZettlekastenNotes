# lang.py.module.numpy.operations.arithmetics

General math operations as methods of an array or as
numpy functions

## Synopsis

```py
  import numpy as np

  <array>.<operation>([<axis>])
  np.<operation>(<array>, [<axis>])
```

## Overview

This operations will **commonly perform** some type of
**aggregation/reduction** of our data

- `.sum()`: Calculate the **sum** of all the elements in the array
- `.prod()`: Calculate the product of array elements or a given axis
- `.std()`: Calculate the **standard deviation** of the elements
- `.max()`: Calculate the **max value** of the elements
- `.mean()`: Calculate the **mean value** of the elements

This operations can be used as either a method of an array object
or directly from numpy as a function

- You can find a list of all mathematical operations [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html)

## Cookbook

### Perform the operation on an specific dimension axis

Thou most of this operations take into account all the dimensions and elements
from the array to perform their calculations.

You can pass the `axis=<axis-index>` argument to denote an specific axis
dimension to do the operation on

- By default, if not given an axis, most operation will reduce the array to one
  value

```py
  data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

  data.sum(axis=0)                      # array([4, 6])
  data.sum(axis=1)                      # array([3, 7])
  data.sum()                            # 9
```
