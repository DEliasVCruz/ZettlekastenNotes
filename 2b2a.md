# lang.js.syntax.expressions

An expression is a bit of JavaScript code that produces a value

## Synopsis

```js
  1 // produces 1
  "hello" // produces "hello"
  5 * 10 // produces 50
  num > 100 // produces either true or false
  isHappy ? "yes" : "no" // produces a string
```

## Overview

Expressions are always part of a [statement](./6dv1.md), even if that `statement` 
is otherwise empty

- Expressions produce a value, and these values are slotted into statements 

## Cookbook

### Expressions can contain expressions

Expression can be nested with each others

```js
  /* 
  Here there are 5 expressions:

  - Expression #1: The entire expression
  - Expression #2: The addition in the parentheses
  - Expression #3: The first number being added
  - Expression #4: The second number being added
  - Expression #5: The multiplier number at the end
  */

  (5 + 1) * 2 
```

### Passing expression as function arguments

All [function](./vnhh.md) arguments must be `expressions`. Expressions 
produce a value, and that value will be **passed** into the `function`.

`Statements` **don't produce a value**, and so they **can't be used** as 
[function arguments](./vnhh.md)

```js
  console.log(/* Some chunk of JS here */)
```

### Expressions as statements

Here is an expression: `1 + 2 + 3`

If we create a `js` file containing only this expression. Then we'll have
a script with a single `statement`

```js
  /* expression slot */
```
The `statement` is essentially empty aside from its `expression` **slot**. Our 
**expression** `1 + 2 + 3` fills this slot, and our **statement is complete**.
