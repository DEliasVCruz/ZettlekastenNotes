# lang.py.data.set

An unordered collection with no duplicate elements

## Synopsis

```py
  my_set = set(<iterable>)
  my_set = {<inmut-obj>, <inmut-obj>, <inmut-obj>[, ...]}
```

## Overview

A set **contains no duplicate element** even if they were assigned at the
definition of the set, it will **do so automatically**

- A set has the **following characteristics**:

  - Sets are unordered
  - They are iterable
  - Elements are unique
  - A set is mutable
  - The elements of a set must be inmutable
  - The elements can be objects of different types
  - Can't be indexed nor sliced

- It also **supports mathematical operations** like:

  - Union
  - Intersection
  - Difference,
  - Symmetric difference

- **Basic uses** are:

  - Membership testing
  - Eliminating duplicate

You can also create set by using set [comprehension](./7lub.md)

## Cookbook

### Create an empty set

To create an empty set you have to use the `set()` definition, since using an
empty `{}`, will create an empty [dictionary](./0loj.md)

```py
  my_set = set()
```

### Get a list of only the unique letters in a string

You can use sets to get a [list](./7cxo.md) of the unique characters in a
single string

```py
  a = set("abracadabra")
  b = set("alacazam")
  print(a)              # {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
  print(b)              # {'a', 'l', 'c', 'z', 'm'}
```

### Iterate over a set

You can **iterate** over the elements of a set **like any normal iterable**
with a `for loop`

```py
  my_set = {1, 2, 3}

  for element in my_set:
      print(element)
```

### Test for membership

You can test form membership of an element in a set with the `in` statement

```py
  x = {'bar', 'foo'}
  bool('bar' in x)      # True
```

### Get the number of unique values in an iterable

To check the number of unique values in an [iterable](./p7q9.md) such as a list
by wrapping the iterable with the `set()` function and then with `len()`

```py
  my_iterable = ['bar', 'foo', 'baz', 'bar']
  count_unique = len(set(my_iterable))

  print(count_unique)   # 3
```

### Evaluate a set as a boolean

A set that contains **at least one element** is evaluated as a
[thruty](./6auy.md) but an **empty set** is evaluated as a **falsy**

```py
  my_empty_set = set()
  bool(my_empty_set)    # False
```

### Find the union of sets

For example to find the **union** of `a` and `b` with:

- The **union operator**:
  - To be used every element must be a set

- `.union()`: The union method of a set
  - The passed arguments can be any iterable
  - The iterable will be automatically converted to a set

```py
  a = {'foo', 'bar'}
  b = {'bar', 'fuz'}
  c = ['bit', 'foo']

  print(a | b)          # {'foo', 'bar', 'fuz'}
  print(a.union(b))     # {'foo', 'bar', 'bit'}
```

### Find the intersection of sets

For example to find the **intersection** of `a` and `b` with:

- The **intersection operator**
- `.intersection()`: The intersection method of a set

```py
  print(a & b)                  # {'bar'}
  print(a.intersection(c))      # {'foo'}
```

### Find the difference of sets

For example to find elements in `a` but not in `b` with:

- The **difference operator**
- `.difference()`: The difference method of a set

When **multiple sets** are specified, the **operation** is performed from
**left to right**

```py
  print(a - b)                  # {'foo'}
  print(a.difference(b))        # {'bar'}
```

### Find the symetric difference of sets

For example to find the **conjunction** of `a` and `b` with:

- The **symetric difference operator**
  - Allows operating on more than one set

- `.symmetric_difference()`: The conjuction method of a set
  - It does not allow more than one set

This are elements in `a` or `b` but not both

```py
  print(a ^ b ^ c)                      # {'foo', 'fuzz', 'bit'}
  print(a.symmetric_difference(c))      # {'bar', 'bit'}
```

### Find if sets don't have common elements

You can use the `isdisjoint()` method of a set to find if it does not have any
common elements with another set

- It return `True` if `a` and `b` have no common elements

```py
  print(a.isdisjoint(c))        # True
```

### Find subsets and supersets of sets

You can find if one set is contained by another with:

- `.issubset()`: All the elements of the set are in the other
- `.issuperset()`: The set contains every element of the other

This methods allow for comparing the set agains it self and it will return
`True`. To find proper subsets ans supersets use the operators

- `<`: All the elements of the set are in the other, and they are not equal
- `>`: The set contains every element of the other, and they are not equal

```py
  set_1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set_2 = {1, 2}

  print(set_2.issubset(set_1))          # True
  print(set_1.issuperset(set_2))        # True

  print(set_1.issubset(set_1))          # True
  print(set_1 < set_1)                  # False
  print(set_1 > set_2)                  # True
```

### Add elemets to a set

You can add **arbitrary elements** to a set with:

- `.add()`: Add **one element at a time**
- `.update()`: Add **every non repeted element** of an iterable

```py
  my_set = {1, 2}
  extra = [2, 4, 5]

  my_set.add(3)
  print(my_set)                         # {1, 2, 3}

  my_set.update(extra)
  print(my_set)                         # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Remove elements from a set

You can remove elemets form a set with either:

- `.remove()`: **Raises an exception** if the element is not in the set
- `.discard()`: **Does not raise an exception** if the element is not in the set
- `.pop()`: Returns removed element, and **raises expection** if not in the set
- `.clear()`: **Removes all the elements** from a set

All of this methods can only **remove one element at a time**

```py
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

  my_set.remove(3)
  print(my_set)                         # {1, 2, 4, 5}

  my_set.discard(4)
  print(my_set)                         # {1, 2, 5}

  removed = my_set.pop(2)
  print((removed, my_set))              # (2, {1, 5})

  my_set.clear()
  print(my_set)                         # set()
```

### Create a frozen set

You can **create an inmutable set** with the `frozenset()` function. It
**accepts an iterable** and any set operator that does perform mutation

```py
  my_inmutable_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
  my_inmutable_set.add(4)                   # Raises and exception
```

### Create a set of sets

Normally you wouldn't be able to pass sets as the elements of a set since they
are mutable, but with `fronzenset()` you can do so

```py
  set_1 = frozenset([1, 2])
  set_2 = frozenset([3, 4])
  set_3 = {set_1, set_2}
```
