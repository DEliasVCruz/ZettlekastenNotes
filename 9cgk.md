# Color theory for designs

## Selecting a colorscheme

> To make the most of these you should do your research
> about the brand and target customers

1. Write words linked backed to how you want to make the
viewer feel

- Blue colors are linked to a sense of security, if they are
  lighter shades they they are also calming
- Green colors go well with most things
- Red colors are very strong but they can create memorable
  impression

So if you want the user to feel for example:
  - Safe
  - Secure
  - Calm

They you might one to use a blue color, and if you want some
contrast you may use a color that invokes action and movement
as the accent color, like orange. And use that color for
call to action buttons

2. Write down the words that best describe your designs
personality

You could for example want a design that it's
  - Clean
  - Minimal
  - Friendly

And add those below the first section of words that we selected

## How many colors to use

In general try not to use many colors, unless you really know
what you are doing

Monochromatic (using one color only changing it's lightness) can
be quite functional and stylized

You can also use color to stand out from what would normally
be the normal colors used for the industry you are in

When choosing colors, you can select neutral variants of your
primary color to use for things like backgrounds and outlines,
which are things that dont' have to be super saturated

### Harmonization

Tipicaly you would chose:

- A primary color 
- Some less saturated variants of your primary color
- An accent color
- A red, orange, green and blue for general info

You can then harmonize then by balacing out their contrast
ratios, which are just lightness and tone adjustments to
optimize this contrast ratios

This will give you your key colors, that then you can
spred into different tonal shifts, then just choose some
of those and finally dived them semantincally based non dark
and light schemes

### Semantic separation of colors

A good way to separate your colors schemes is in:

- Hierarchy colors
  - Primary colors
  - Secondary colors (Accent colors)
  - Terirary colors

- Surfaces colors
  - What you will use for backgrounds

- Utility colors
  - Error colors
  - Warning colors
  - Info colors
  - Success colors

## Using color correctly

Color has meaning depending on the context, a green color on
a toast notification can mean success. While a yellow on an
icon can mean warning

Creating little condratictions between the color usually
convays to the user and the action or text that will be 
performed can help in **deliberately slowing your users
down** 

This is usefull for situations where you may want them to stop
and think before taking an action, like putting a cancel
button on a dangerous operation in green (instead of red)

If we remove any text, icons or extra contextual data from
the color then we are left with literal colors that by
themselves are only **culturaly meaningfull** 

1. Literal Context
2. Cultura Context

Remember that even if you remove **literal context** there
still is **cultural context** behind a color

> Remember that your work exists in the context of all
> the other apps your users interact with

UI don't exists in a vacuum, when we open software we arrive
with pre-concived notions of what certain things are going
to mean

## Building a color system

They are rules for how you use color in your apps, and there
are two kinds

- Static Systems
- Dynamic Systems

### Static Systems

They are the bulk of the usual color systems, where you have
a set of pre-defined colors that you are allowed to choose
from

This colors are just a list of available colors withouth literal
context to them. Then it's on the designer to decide what each 
color is supposed to be used for

> It's a set where the colors don't change

- For example the color schemes in tailwind, they are a list
  of available colors to choose from

### Dynamic Systems

They are newer, and it's where you can put an image or wallpaper
and it will extract the colors from that asset an then the whole
UI will become tinted by those extracted color pallets

## Tools you can use

- [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/): A free tool for generating color schemes
  - You can also use it to search schemes based on your keywords
  - You can search by going to the `explore` option
- [Sessions College color calculatgor](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/): 
  - You can use this to give it your primary color and then 
    start playing around with what may also work with it
- [Pygment](https://pigment.shapefactory.co/): 
  - You can use this to test the contrasting look between dual 
    color schemes (only two colors)
