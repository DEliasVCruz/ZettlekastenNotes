# lang.py.oper.classes.magic_method

Special class methods that give specialized functionalities to your class

## Synopsis

```py
  def __<magic-method>__(self[, <extra-arguments>]):
      <operations>
```

## Overview

This magic methods **define** your **class behavior when** their corresponding
**function** is **called on them**, therefore you could technically give your
class a behavior for every magic method.

### Representation (`__repr__`)

When an object is generated the default value that `Python` outputs when the
object is called by itself is:

```py
  <<object-name> object <object-type> at <memory-adress>>
```

Which is not very helpful by it self. So with this magic method you can
**define the official object representation** that will be outputted when the
`repr()` is called on the object.

The **convention** is to **build** this representation **the same way** that
you **instantiated the object**, so that **any** one **can recreate** it from
it's representation

To **account for subclasses** that will inherit from this parent class, when
referencing the name of the class you can **use** the **magic attribute**
`__class__.__name__` that will **give** you the **name** of the **current
class** and not it's parents or children

```py
  class Employee:
      def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
          self.first = first
          self.last = last
          self.pay = pay

      def __repr__(self)
          return (f"{self.__class__.__name__}"
                  f""('{self.first!r}','{self.last!r}',{self.pay!r})")

  empolyee_1 = Employee("Daniel", "Vilela", 1000)
  print(repr(employee_1))           # Employee('Daniel', 'Vilela', 1000)
```

### String (`__str__`)

This will define what happens when the `str()` function is called on your
object. It **should return** a **short**, **human-readable** text, which **includes**
**information** from the **most relevant attributes**

The difference with `__repr__` is that the **representation should** provide
**complete information** about an object, to **allow for restoring its state**
from a string.

```py
  class User:
      def __init__(self, login, password):
          self.login = login
          self.password = password

      def __str__(self):
          return self.login

      def __repr__(self):
          return f"User('{self.login}', '{self.password}')"

  user_1 = User('joseR29', 's3cr3t')
  print(str(user_1))                    # joseR29
```

### Custom Iterators (`__iter__` and `__next__`)

If you want your **class** to **be iterable** you can specify the **magic methods**
`__iter__` and `__next__` to **create a custom** [iterable](./p7q9.md)

### Context Manager (`__enter__` and `__exit__`)

If you want to **define your own** [context manager](./1rwn.md) you'll need to
create a custom class with the `__enter__` and `__exit__` magic methods since
this is what the `with` statement **will call** on your class **upon entering**
the `with` statement **and upon exiting** the `with` **statement block
respectively**

- `__enter__`: Invoked when calling the `with` statement
- `__exit__`: Called upon exiting from the `with` statement block

```py
  class my_file_reader():
      def __init__(self, file_path):
          self.__path = file_path
          self.__file_object = None

      def __enter__(self):
          self.__file_object = open(self.__path)
          return self

      def __exit__(self, type, val, tb):
          self.__file_object.close()
```

### State management (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`)

### Comparison (`__eq__`)

When creating custom classes and their instances, there might be cases where
you may want to compare for equality between two instances of your classes

By default `Python` would not know how to handle equality between two instances
of your class. That is why you may have to specify this special functionality
yourself with the `__eq__` method

The most common way is to check for equality by comparing that the attributes
of each instance are equal. Usually the **instance being compared to** is
**referenced as** `other`

- It's a good practice to always define this in your class
- Modules like [dataclass](./rm1a.md) will handle this out of the box

```py
  class Person(self, name, age)
      self.name = name
      self.age = age

  def __eq__(self, other):
      if other.__class__ is self.__class__:
          return (self.name, self.age) == (other.name, other.age)
      return NotImplemented
```

### Class definition (`__call__`, `__new__`, `__init__`)

There are **three main process** that happen when creating an instance of a
call:

1. The class is **called**
2. A **new** object is **created**
3. The **instance** of the class is **initialized**

For each of this events **there is a corresponding** `magic method` to
**handle** code **execution** when dealing with this events

- The `__call__` method:

  This method is invoke when the class is called and it's **default behavior**
  is to **call** the `__new__` method **and initialize** it with the `__init__`
  method

- The `__new__` method:

  It's invoked **when** a class **object** is **created** and before the
  instance is imitated

- The `__init__` method:

  Here the instance of the class is actually initiated and is usually **where**
  the instance **main attributes** are **set and given values**

```py
  class Person:

      def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
          # Some pre object creation and instance initiation process
          return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs) # Call the default behaviour

      def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):
          pass

      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
```

### Local method variables manipulation (`__prepare__`)

**During** the **creation** of a class, the **body is executed** and the
**local variables** that are defined in the body (like the ones in methods) are
**saved into** a [dictionary](./0loj.md)

If you define a `__prepare__` method then it's **return value** is **used as**
the **local variables dictionary**

### Descriptors (`__set__`, `__get__`, `__delete__`)
