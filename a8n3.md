# lang.py.oper.classes.magic_method

Special class methods that give specialized funtionalitis to your class

## Synopsis

```py
  def __<magic-method>__(self[, <extra-arguments>]):
      <operations>
```

## Overview

This magic methods **define** your **class behaviour when** their corresponding
**function** is **called on them**, therefore you could technically give your
class a behaviour for every magic method.

### Representation (`__repr__`)

When an object is generated the default value that `Python` outputs when the
objet is called by itself is:

```py
  <<object-name> object <object-type> at <memory-adress>>
```

Which is not very helpfull by it self. So with this magic method you can
**define the official object representation** that will be outputed when the
`repr()` is called on the object.

The **convention** is to **build** this representation **the same way** that
you **instantiated the object**, so that **any** one **can recreate** it from
it's representation

To **account for subclasses** that will inherit from this parent class, when
referencing the name of the class you can **use** the **magic attribute**
`__class__.__name__` that will **give** you the **name** of the **current
class** and not it's parents or childs

```py
  class Employee:
      def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
          self.first = first
          self.last = last
          self.pay = pay

      def __repr__(self)
          return f"{self.__class__.__name__}('{self.first}','{self.last}',{self.pay})"

  empolyee_1 = Employee("Daniel", "Vilela", 1000)
  print(repr(employee_1))           # Employee('Daniel', 'Vilela', 1000)
```

### Custom Iterators (`__iter__` and `__next__`)

If you want your **class** to **be iterable** you can specify the **magic methods**
`__iter__` and `__next__` to **create a custom** [iterable](./p7q9.md)

### Context Manager (`__enter__` and `__exit__`)

If you want to **define your own** [context manager]() you'll need to create a
custom class with the `__enter__` and `__exit__` magic methods since this is
what the `with` statement **will call** on your class **upon entering**  the
`with` statement **and upon exiting** the `with` **statement block respectively**

- `__enter__`: Invoked when calling the `with` statement
- `__exit__`: Called upon exiting from the `with` statement block

```py
  class my_file_reader():
      def __init__(self, file_path):
          self.__path = file_path
          self.__file_object = None

      def __enter__(self):
          self.__file_object = open(self.__path)
          return self

      def __exit__(self, type, val, tb):
          self.__file_object.close()
```
