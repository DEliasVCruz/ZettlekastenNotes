# lang.py.oper.classes.magic_method

Special class methods that give specialized funtionalitis to your class

## Synopsis

```py
  def __<magic-method>__(self[, <extra-arguments>]):
      <operations>
```

## Overview

This magic methods **define** your **class behaviour when** their corresponding
**function** is **called on them**, therefore you could technically give your
class a behaviour for every magic method.

### Representation (`__repr__`)

When an object is generated the default value that `Python` outputs when the
objet is called by itself is:

```py
  <<object-name> object <object-type> at <memory-adress>>
```

Which is not very helpfull by it self. So with this magic method you can
**define the official object representation** that will be outputed when the
`repr()` is called on the object.

The **convention** is to **build** this representation **the same way** that
you **instantiated the object**, so that **any** one **can recreate** it from
it's representation

To **account for subclasses** that will inherit from this parent class, when
referencing the name of the class you can **use** the **magic attribute**
`__class__.__name__` that will **give** you the **name** of the **current
class** and not it's parents or childs

```py
  class Employee:
      def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
          self.first = first
          self.last = last
          self.pay = pay

      def __repr__(self)
          return f"{self.__class__.__name__}('{self.first}','{self.last}',{self.pay})"

  empolyee_1 = Employee("Daniel", "Vilela", 1000)
  print(repr(employee_1))           # Employee('Daniel', 'Vilela', 1000)
```
