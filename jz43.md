# cli.git.gh_flow

Is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where
deployments are made regularly.

## Overview

The standard [git-flow](./26yk.md) workflow **can be** more **complicated**
than what most projects actually require. The github flow model gives an **easy
and simple** alternative.

The `git-flow` model is designed around **releases**. Which is at odd with a
project that is **designed to deploy to production everyday**, since it doesn't
really have releases

With this model there is no **difference between** a **hotfix** and a **very small
feature** since a **frequent deploy** introudeces **small** progressive
**changes** they can be **fixed and redeployed very quickly**.

## Workflow

### Create a branch

Branching is the base of the workflow and there is only **one rule**:

> Anything in the main branch is always deployable

Therefore, new branches should be created of off `main` and they should **be
descriptive**:

- refactor-authentication
- user-content-cache-key
- make-retina-avatars

### Add commits

Commits should encompass a **separate unit of change**, so that it **let's you roll
back** changes if a bug is found or want to head in a different direction.

Remember to write **clear commit messages** using **commit standers**. And they
should **explain why** a particular **change was made**.

### Open a pull request

They **initiate discussion** about your commits, through **code review** . With
this anyone can**see what changes would be merged** if they accept your request

Can be **opened at any point** in the development process:

- Little to no code but want to **share general ideas**
- If you are **stuck or need help**
- You are ready to **someone to review your work**

In **open source** projects this **notify project maintainers** about the
**changes** you'd like them **to consider**.

### Discuss and review your code

Once a Pull Request has been opened, the people reviewing your changes
may have questions or comments.

You can **continue to push to your branch** in response to discussion and
feedback, you can **fix it up** in your branch and **push up the changes**.

### Deploy

With **GitHub**, you can **deploy from a branch for** final **testing** in
production **before merging** to main

**If** your branch causes **issues**, you can **roll it back** by **deploying**
the **existing main branch** into production.

There might be **different deploying strategies based on** the other elements
in **their workflow**:

- Deploy to a specially **provisioned testing environment**
- Deploying **directly to production**

### Merge

Once merged, **Pull Requests** preserve a **record** of the **historical
changes** to your code.

You can **associate issues with code**, with certain keywords such as `Closes #32`
will indicate that the corresponding **merge cleses issue 32** in ther repo
