# lang.psql.functions

Basic support for built-in or user specified functions to operate on queries

## Aggregation Functions

This are functions that **do** some **operation** on **all the records of
specified fields**

### COUNT()

Count the **number of occurrences** of records in a field. It's best used in
combination with `GROUP BY` command

```sql
  SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth
```

### MAX()

Get the record with the maximum vale on an specified field

```sql
  SELECT MAX(price) FROM car;
```

### MIN()

Get the record with the minimum vale on an specified field
vale on an specified field

```sql
  SELECT MAX(price) FROM car;
```

### SUM()

Get the addition of the values in the records of a field

```sql
  SELECT brand, SUM(price) FROM car
  GROUP BY brand;
```

### AVG()

Get the avg of the values in the records of a field

```sql
  SELECT AVG(price) FROM car;
```

### ROUND()

Round up all the values in the records of a field. It **can round based on a
decimal precision**

```sql
  SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2) FROM car;
```

## Buit-in function

### COALESCE(field, default-value)

You can specify a **default value if the record is null**. In general it
returns the first value in it's list of arguments that is not null

```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(email, "No email given") FROM person;
```

### NOW()

Return the **timestamp** as a **date** [type](./x350.md) at the moment it was
called. To **get an specific part** of the timestamp you can **append**
`::<part>` to the function

```sql
  SELECT NOW()::[DATE|TIME];
```

### EXTRACT(MEASURE FROM date-type)

If given a [date](./ysvb.md) type you **only want a specific part of that
timestamp** like for example **the year or the month, etc**.

```sql
  SELECT EXCTRACT(YEAR FROM NOW());
```

### AGE(ending_date, starting_date)

Calculate the elapsed time between two dates

```sql
  SELECT AGE(NOW(), DATE "1998-07-04");
```

### CONCAT()

You can **concatenate** different values together

```sql
  SELECT CONCAT('m', martian_id) AS id,
  first_name, last_name,
  FROM martian_public;
```
