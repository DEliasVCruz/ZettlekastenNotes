Work with remote repositories

## Synopis

```sh
  git remote [<options>|<subcommands>] [<remote-name>] [<remote-url>]
```

## Overview

You can have **multiple remote repositories** you are pushing or fetching from.
You may **not necessarily** even need to **fetch and pull from the same**
remote

You **can have central repo** as a remote, but you **can also have** the repos
from your **colleges as remote repos** to track

## Options

- `-v`: Verbose list of remotes (with url and permissions)
- `-u`: Set a local branch to automatically track an specified remote branch

## Subcommands

- `add`: Add a new remote
- `remove`: Remove a remote
- `get-url`: Find the url to a specific remote
- `set-url`: Change the url of an existing remote
- `set-head`: set or delete default branch for a remote

## Cookbook

### List all remotes

By default **calling** `remote` alone will list all of the remotes your repo is
working with

```sh
  git remote
```

But you can pass the `-v` option that will also **print** out the **urls** and
the **strategies** (`fetch`, `push`) for each remote

```sh
  git remote -v
```

### Make a local branch track a remote branch

With this every time you run `push` and `fetch` while [checking](./it3j.md) out that
branch it will **automatically** do it **with the specified remote repo**

```sh
  git branch -u origin/<BRANCH> <BRANCH>
```

### Set the default branch for a remote

A remote repo can have many `origin/<branch>` [branch](./j4in.md), so you can **define**
what will be the **default branch** to which `origin/HEAD` will point to

```sh
  git remote set-head origin -a
```

### Add a new remote repo

You can add a new remote with the `add` subcommand, the repo. You can add or
remove remote repositories at any point in your project lifecycle.

**Remotes don't necessarily** have to **match** their **name with** the **local
name** you give them. For example, a **remote repo** that **on GitHub** is called
**CristalMoon, can be called origin** in your local repo

- To **add a remote**:

```sh
  git remote add <remote-name> <url-to-remote>
```

- To **remove a remote**:

```sh
  git remote remove <remote-name>
```

### Add remote Github repository

Sometimes you may have already a **local repo** that you want to **track it
with a GitHub remote**.

From then on **whenever** you run `git push` or `git fetch` it will **automatically**
do it with the **default branch and remote**

```sh
  git branch -u origin/<BRANCH> <BRANCH>
  git remote set-head origin -a
  git push origin main
```

- Don't create any file in that remote. If you do use:

```sh
  git push -force <remote> <branch>
```

This way you **force the local branch to overwrite the remote**
