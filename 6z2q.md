# cli.git.stash

Sometimes you may be working on various changes but you may need to **put your
current changes aside temporarily**

## Overview

As an example you may want to [checkout](./it3j.md) **another branches but you
haven't yet** [committed](./nr07.md) **the changes**

TODO: **_THIS NEED MORE RESEARCH_**

## Synopsis

```sh
  git stash [push|pop|save|apply|list|clear|drop] [<stashname>|<stashindex>]
```

## Commands

- `push`: Create a stash
- `pop`: Remove a stashed from the stash list and apply it
- `save`: give your stash a name to reference it by later
  - Use `push -m` instead
- `apply`: Like `pop` but don't remove the stash from the list
  - **Can work on anything that looks like a stash entrie**
- `list`: List stashed changes
- `drop`: Delete a stash from the list without applying it
- `clear`: Remove all the stash entries

## Options

- `-p`: Interactively select stashes
- `-m`: Add a message
- `--include-untracked`: Include [untracked](./4tak.md) files
- `--all`: Include ignored files

## Cookbook

### Stash your working changes without committing them

This will create **two extra commits**. One as an index of what you did in the
original commit you were on and another as a WIP commit of what you've stashed

```sh
  git stash push
```

### Add stashed changes back and eliminate stash pointer

```sh
  git stash pop
```

### Apply your stashed changes without eliminating the pointer stash

If you **just want to apply the stashed change** but you don't want the stash
pointer to be delete, maybe for **later use**

This is **depreceated by** `git stash push -m` to **add a discription**

```sh
# On your current commit
  git stash save <stashname> # Optional: reference by a name
  git stash list # Optional: Find your stash by its reference name
  git stash apply [<stashindex>]
```

### Eliminate all of your stash changes and pointers

This **will not apply the stashed changes to your current commit**

```sh
  git stash clear
```

## Eliminate a stashed change from your list

You may have too many stashed changes and you want to erase some of them

```sh
  git stash drop <stashindex>
```

### Create a new branch with your staged changes

Sometimes you may want to keep your changes but they **don't belong to the main
branch** then you can **create a new branch and apply the stashed changes on one
command**.

```sh
  git stash branch <branchname> [<stash>]
```

### Interactively save stashes with a message

You can select which stashes to use

```lua
  git stash push -p -m <message>
```
