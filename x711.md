# cli.py.debug.pdb.step

Step through the code execution of a program

## Synopsis

```pdb
  (Pdb) n
```

## Overview

You can step throught the code execution of your program in **various ways**
depending on **what you want to be executed next**

## Cookbook

### Step over your code

When you are **stepping over code** you will not go into any external call that
will move you out of your current scope

In other words, you are **keeping** yourself **local**. For example, if you had
a function call it **would not get into the function definition** but just
**execute** the call and **move to the next statement**

```pdb
  (Pdb) n
```

### Step into your code

This **will get out of your current scope** and into the scope of whatever external
call is stepping through

For example, this **would get into the function definition** of the called function
and leave the current scope

```pdb
  s
  --Call--                  # Execution stopped due to external call
  <call-scope-and-code>
  [--Return--]              # Execution stopped due to return statement

  [<file-name>(<line>)<funtion-name>()-><returned-value>]
```

### Step over to the next code line

You can use `unt` to step into either:

- Stop at the next line greater than the current line
- Stop at the next line greater or equal to an specified line

This **defers from** `n` since `unt` **won't iterate over a loop** and will just
continue to the next line

```pdb
  (Pdb) unt 13              # Stop at line 13
```

### Step through breakpoints

You can use the `c` command to **continue execution** of the code uninterrupted
**until another** [breakpoint](./u9f4.md) is **found and hit** in your code

```pdb
  (Pdb) c
```
