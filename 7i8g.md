Working with file (open, read, write)

## Synopsis

```py
  with open(r'./filename', ['r'|'r+'|'a+']) as <alias>:
      [operations with <alias>]
```

## Overview

When working with text files you can **perform** operations of **reading,
writing** and more

Thou you don't necessarily need it's **best practice** to use a [context manager]()
**to automatically handle** the **closing** of the file once it's no longer used.
Otherwise, you would need to manually call `file.close()`

There are two types of files you can work with:

- **Text Files**: Each **line is terminated** with a `\n` character
- **Binary Files**: There is **no terminator** for a **line**

### Access Mode

How the file will be used once it's opened. They also define the **File
Handle** which indicates from **where** the **data has to be read or written**
in the file

- **Read Only** (`'r'`):
  - **Default** mode of opening
  - **Handle** positioned at the **beginning**
  - **Raises** `I/O` [error](./t7gf.md) if file don't exist

- **Write Only** (`'w'`):
  - **Handle** positioned at the **beginning**
  - For existing file, the **data** is truncated and **over-written**

- **Append Only** (`'a'`):
  - The file is **created if it don't exist**
  - **Handle** positioned at the **end of file**

- **Read and Write** (`'r+'`):
  - **Handle** positioned at the **beginning**
  - **Raises** `I/O` error if file don't exist

- **Write and Read** (`'w+'`):
  - **Handle** positioned at the **beginning**
  - For existing file, the **data** is truncated and **over-written**

- **Append and Read** (`'a+'`):
  - Open for **reading and writing**
  - **Handle** positioned at the **end of file**
  - The file is **created if it don't exist**
  - **Data written** will be inserted **after existing one**

## Cookbook

### Working with a file best practice

The more **pythonic** way of handling a file in `Python` is by using the
[pathlib]() module and a [logging]() library to keep up with the operations.
And group all of this in an [exception](./wvgx.md) block to catch any errors

```py
  import pathlib
  import logging

  file_path = pathlib.Path("hello.txt")

  try:
      with file_path.open(mode="w") as file:
          file.write("Hello, World!")
  except OSError as error:
      logging.error("Writing to file %s failed due to: %s", file_path, error)
```

### Go back to the beginning of a file

As you read from a file, the **handler** will be moved from where it began so
if you want to **get access back to the beginning of the file** you will need to
use the `seek()` method

Here `seek(n)` takes the file handle to the nth bite from the beginning, in
this case 0

```py
  file1 = open("myfile.txt", "r+")
  data = file1.read()
  file1.seek(0)
```

### Write line from a list in to a file

You can use the `writelines()` method to write elements from a list object into
a file from the beginning of set file

```py
  L = ["This is Delhi \n", "This is Paris \n", "This is London \n"]

  with open("myfile.txt", "w") as file1:
    file1.write("Hello \n")
    file1.writelines(L)
```

### Get the path name of the file of the loaded module

When you [import](./2oy5.md) a module if you wanted to now the **file path
name** of the **loaded module** you can use the `__file__` **magic attribute**
to get the relative path to the current running scripts

```py
  import re

  print(re.__file__)    # '/usr/lib/python3.9/re.py'
```

### Read lines of a file without the \n ending

Sometimes **lines** in a file **might end with** `\n` which will be interpreted
as a new line character and such treated as an extra element line

If you want to **avoid** reading **this** character you can use:

```py
  lines = <alias>.read().splitlines()
```

Or use a list [comprehension](./7lub.md):

```py
  lines = [line[:-1] for line in <alias>]
```

### Working with multiple files at the same time

Sometimes you may need to **open and handle more than one file** at the same time,
like in the case you may want to **read from a file and write into another**

```py
  d_path = 'dog_breeds.txt'
  d_r_path = 'dog_breeds_reversed.txt'
  with open(d_path, 'r') as reader, open(d_r_path, 'w') as writer:
      dog_breeds = reader.readlines()
      writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))
```

### Append something to the end of a file

It is the **same as writing to a file** but use the access method `a` to position
the **handle at the end** of the file

```py
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'a') as a_writer:
      a_writer.write('\nBeagle')
```

### Common file handling libraries

There are many libraries desigin to handle specific file types

- **tarfile**: read and write tar archive files
- **zipfile**: work with ZIP archives
- **configparser**: easily create and parse configuration files
- **xml.etree.ElementTree**: create or read XML based files
- **PyPDF2**: PDF toolkit
- **xlwings**: read and write Excel files
- **pillow**: image rendering and manipulation

### Create your own file handler

You can define a custom file handler by defining your own [context manager]()
with a special [class](./unhs.md) that will have the [magic methods](./a8n3.md)
`__enter__` and `__exit__}`
