# lang.py.oper.file

Working with file (open, read, write)

## Synopsis

```py
  with open("./filename", ["r"|"w"]) as <alias>:
      [operations with <alias>]
```

## Overview

When working with text files you can **perform** operations of **reading,
writting** and more

Thou you don't necessarily need it's **best practice** to use a [context manager]()
**to automatically handle** the **closing** of the file once it's no longer used.
Otherwise, you would need to manually call `file.close()`

## Cookbook

### Read lines of a file without the \n ending

Sometimes **lines** in a file **might end with** `\n` which will be interpreted
as a new line character and such treated as an extra element line

If you want to **avoid** reading **this** character you can use:

```py
  lines = <alias>.read().splitlines()
```

Or use a list [comprehension](./7lub.md):

```py
  lines = [line[:-1] for line in <alias>]
```
