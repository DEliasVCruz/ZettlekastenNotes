# lang.py.module.pdf.pdfplumber

Advance data extraction and manipulation of PDF files

## Synopsis

```py
  import pdfplumber

  with pdfplumber.open('file.pdf') as pdf:
      ...
```

## Overview

You can use this as a general PDF extraction and manipulation tools since it
**builds on top** of [pdfminer](./fwzt.md) and it has the **capability** to recognize
and **extract** structured data in **tables**

## Cookbook

### Open a PDF file as an object

The module **provides** a special `open()` **function** to open a PDF file into
an object

It returns an instance of the `pdfblumber.PDF()` class

- `password`: Use a password to open if the file is encrypted

```py
  import pdfplumber

  with pdfplumber.open('file.pdf') as pdf:
      print(pdf)
```

### Get the metadata of the page

You can have access to basic metadata information of the pdf as a
[dictionary](./0loj.md) with the `.metada` attribute

```py
  pdf.metadata['CreationDate']          # Get the creation date
```

### Get the pages of a PDF file

You can get the pages of a pdf as an **indexable and sliceable**
[list](./7cxo.md) with the `.pages` attribute

Each page is an instance of the `pdfblumber.Page()` object

```py
  first_page = pdf.pages[0]

  for page in pdf.pages[1:]:
      print(page)
```

### Get the page number of a page

You can get the `one-index` **sequential number** of a page with the
`.page_number` attribute

```py
  first_page = pdf.pages[0]
  first_page.page_number                # 1
```

### Extract text from a page

You can extract all the text of a page as a single [string](./4t3v.md) with the
`extract_text()` method of the page object

```py
  for page in pdf.pages:
      print(page.extract_text().split('\n'))
```

### Extract tables from a page

You can extract all the tables in a page with the `extract_tables()` method
that **returns a list of tables as lists**

You can also use `extract_table()` to get the **largest table** in the page

```py
  first_table = page.extract_tables()[0]
  first_row = first_table[0]
  first_cel = first_row[0]
  print(first_cel)                      # 'Nombre'
```
