### Iterating over the file system

If you want to **scan a directory** and **perform operations** over it's
**files and** sub **directories**, the most **optimal way** to traverse a
directory structure is to use the `scandir()` fucntion that return an
[iterable](./p7q9.md) object corresponding to the **entries in a given
directory**

Note that `scandir()` is a resource that need **closing** so `scandir.close()`
needs to be called on the **dir** object after is done being used. There fore
we use a [context manager](./1rwn.md)

```py
  import os

  with os.scandir(".") as entries:
      for entry in entries:
          print(entry.name, "->", entry.stat().st_size, "bytes")
```
