# lang.py.module.os

An interface for basic operations with the underlying os

## Synopsis

```py
  import os
```

## Overview

You can use the `os` module to perform basic sistem operations and intereact
with it's underlying tools or the [file system](./bwao.md)

### Iterating over the file system

If you want to **scan a directory** and **perform operations** over it's
**files and** sub **directories**, the most **optimal way** to traverse a
directory structure is to use the `scandir()` fucntion that return an
[iterable](./p7q9.md) object corresponding to the **entries in a given
directory**

Note that `scandir()` is a resource that need **closing** so `scandir.close()`
needs to be called on the **dir** object after is done being used. There fore
we use a [context manager](./1rwn.md)

```py
  import os

  with os.scandir(".") as entries:
      for entry in entries:
          print(entry.name, "->", entry.stat().st_size, "bytes")
```

### Create or remove a directory

You can create new directories with the `mkdir()` method. It will create the
directory **relative to the current working directory or an absolute path** if a
full path is given

You can use the `rmdir()` method to **remove a directory**

```py
  os.mkdir('new_dir')
  os.rmdir('new_dir')
```

### Get and change the cwd

You can **find** the **currenwt working directory** and **change to a new one**
with the `getcwd()` and `chdir()` methods respectively

```py
  os.getcwd()       # ~/Documentos/Prueba
  os.chdir('..')
  os.getcwd()       # ~/Documentos
```
