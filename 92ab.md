# lang.py.module.numpy.brodcasting

Expand and duplicate the dimensions of an array until they match and can be
operated against

## Overview

**Extending** two **arrays of different shapes** and figuring out **how to**
perform a **vectorized calculation** between them

Arrays **can be brodcasted** against each other **if either**:

- Their **dimensions match** (have the same shape length)
- **One** of the arrays **has only one dimension**

When **performing operations**, it will:

1. **Duplicate the data of the smaller dimension until** it **matches the
   longest dimension**.
2. Then it performs the operations for each corresponding matching element

It will do this for every dimension **until** the arrays have the **same shape
values**
