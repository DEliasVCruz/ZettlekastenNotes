Number the lines of a file

## Synopsis

```sh
  nl [options] <file>
```

## Overview

You can **numbers in front of each line** of a file and display them alongside
them. To **read from standard input** you need to pass `-`

- **Options**:

  - `-b`: Number only blank lines
    - `a`: Number all lines
    - `p`: Number lines that match regex

## Cookbook

### Number only non blank lines

By **default** the `nl` command will only **number lines that are not blank**

```sh
  echo "line\n\nline" | nl -
  -> 1 line
  ->
  -> 2 line
```

### Number only blank lines

You can number **only** the **blank lines** with the `-b` option

```sh
  echo "line\n\nline" | nl -
  -> line
  -> 1
  -> line
```

### Number all the lines

The `-b` option **can take** different **arguments** one of them is `a` that
**numbers all** blank and non blank lines

But is **better** to do this with the `cat -n` command

```sh
  echo "line\n\nline" | nl -b a -
```

### Number lines that match a regex

You can pass the `p'<regex>'` argument to the `-b` option to only **number
lines** that **match** the given **regex expression**

```sh
  nl -b p'[Hh]ello' file.txt
```
