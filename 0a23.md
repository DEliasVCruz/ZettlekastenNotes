### Find all installed fonts

This is how you **view all** your **installed fonts**

```sh
  fc-list | fzf
```

### Find all truetype fonts

This **will take a while**

```sh
  sudo find / -type f -name "*.ttf"
```

### Install new fonts

Fonts are located in different directories. You can install them in any of
them, but fonts in the `~/.fonts` directory **will only be available for your
user**

- `/usr/share/fonts`
- `/usr/local/share/fonts`
- `~/.fonts`

After **copying the fonts** into the given folder. **Refresh the fonts cache**

```sh
  sudo fc-cache -f -v
```
