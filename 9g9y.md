# lang.rst.syntax.links

We can create links to external resources and we can even **name them** in
**variables**

## Synopsis

```rst
  `text <link>`_
```

## Cookbook

### Insert an inline text

You need to wrap your linked text in `backticks` and end it with an
`underscore`

```rst
  Donwload `Python <https://python.org>`_ now.
```

### Named links

You can **asign links to variables** for later reference

```rst
  Donwload `Python`_ now, because
  `Python`_ is a popular programming
  language

  .. _Python: https://python.org
```
