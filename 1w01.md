Storing boolean data as bits

## Synopsis

```c
const short FLAG_ON = 1 << 0;

short flags = 0;

// Set the flag as true
flags |= FLAG_ON;
```

## Overview

To store `boolean` like data (like **flags**) compactly and 
efficiently we make use of storing them as pure bits in 
a bite, where the `true` value is represented by a `1` 
and the `false` value is represented by a `0`

It is based on **`boolean` logic** (manipulation of `true`
and `false` values through logical operations)

> Since `c11` the `stdint.h` library allows programmers
> to specify integer types that are exactly some number
> of bytes

## Cookbook

### Creating bit mask flags

The numbers needed to make this bit masks are usually produce 
using [bit shifting](./129e.md)

Where every flag has the singular bit that represents the
flag as **seted** (with the value `1`)

Then this bit mask is used to compare against a `byte` that
has colects the states of the flags through [bit wise](./ommm.md) 
operations

```c
const short FLAG_TRANSPARENT = 1 << 0; // 1  (0x01)
const short FLAG_MOVEMENT    = 1 << 1; // 2  (0x02)

const short flags = 0; // No setted flags
```

### Setting a bit

You can **set** (making it have the value `1`) of a bit at
`n` position in the `byte` by using the `|` operation with
a number that is equal to `2^n`

> Its equivalent to setting to `true` a bit flag

```c
// flags is 00000000
flags |= 1 << 2;     // 00000000 or 00000100

// flags is 00000100
```

### Clearing a bit

You can clear (making it have the value `0`) a bit at
`n` position in the `byte` by using the `&` operation with
the **negation** of a number that is equal to `2^n`

> It's equivalent to setting to `false` a bit flag

```c
// flags is 00000100
flags &= ~(1 << 2);    // 00000100 and 11111011

// flags is 00000000
```

### Flipping a bit

You can flip (make it's value be the oposite of the 
current one) a bit at `n` position in the `byte` by
`xor` it with the `^` against a number that it's equal
to `2^n`

> It's equivalent to inverse the value of the bit

```c
// flags is 00000000
flags ^= 1 << 2;     // 00000000 xor 00000100

// flags is 00000100
flags ^= 1 << 2;     // 00000100 xor 00000100

// flags is 00000000
```

### Checking a bit

You can get the current value of a bit at the `n`
position by `and` it with `&` against a number that
it's equal to `2^n`

```c
// flags is 01011001
flag = flags & (1 << 3); // flag is 00001000
flag = flags & (1 << 2); // flag is 00000000
```

### An example of bit masking

Here is a an example were we do vairous operations on bit
flags from settign to negating them

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>

/* Finish initializing the flags */

const short FLAG_ON          = 1 << 0; // 1  (0x01)
const short FLAG_MOVEMENT    = 1 << 1; // 2  (0x02)
const short FLAG_TRANSPARENT = 1 << 2; // 4  (0x04)
const short FLAG_ALIVE       = 1 << 3; // 8  (0x08)
const short FLAG_BROKEN      = 1 << 4; // 16 (0x10)
const short FLAG_EDIBLE      = 1 << 5; // 32 (0x20)

int main() {
  short attributes = 0;

  /* Set the attributes ON, TRANSPARENT, and BROKEN */
  attributes |= (FLAG_ON | FLAG_TRANSPARENT | FLAG_BROKEN);

  assert(attributes == (FLAG_ON | FLAG_TRANSPARENT | FLAG_BROKEN));

  /* Modify (set/clear/toggle) so the only attributes are ON and ALIVE */
  attributes ^= (FLAG_ALIVE | FLAG_TRANSPARENT | FLAG_BROKEN);
    
  assert(attributes == (FLAG_ON | FLAG_ALIVE));

  /* Check if the ALIVE flag is set */
  assert(FLAG_ALIVE == (attributes & FLAG_ALIVE));

  /* Check if the BROKEN flag is not set */
  assert(0 == (attributes & FLAG_BROKEN));

  /* Modify so only the EDIBLE attribute is set */
  attributes = (attributes & ~attributes) | FLAG_EDIBLE;
  assert(attributes == FLAG_EDIBLE);

  printf("Done!");
}
```
