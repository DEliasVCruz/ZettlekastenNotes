# lang.py.module.numpy.types

Low level data types exposed by numpy

## Synopsis

```py
  import numpy as np

  data = np.array([<data>], dtype=[np.]<type>)
```

## Overview

You can **specify the precise data type** to use for the elements in your
array. This will **help on memory management** as it can optimize storage

By default `NumPy` will handle this on it's own but you **can do it manually**
with the `dtype` argument

## Cookbook
