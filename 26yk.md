# cli.git.flow

A development model centered around git that defines a branching strategy
(feature, develop, release, hot fixes and main branch) and release management

## Overview

A git **workflow** designed for building software that is **explicitly
versioned**, or if you need to **support multiple versions** of your software.

It is not, however, designed for projects that **require continuously
delivered**, not rolled back, and you **don't have to support multiple
versions** of the software; such as **web apps**.

For this type of projects it is suggested to use a simpler **workflow** like
[GitHub flow](./jz43.md)

## Merging strategy

We will ensure that [merges](./drni.md) **always create a new commit** object,
**even if** it could be performed with a **fast-forward**.

This is to **avoid losing** information about the **historical existence of a
branch**, as well as it groups together all commits that added to the branch,
compared to a **single continuous history** from where is **hard to assess** what
**commits** should be **grouped** together

## The main branches

The workflow always consists of **two main** [branches](./j4in.md) with an
**infinite lifetime**

- **main**:

  - The `origin/main` branch always reflects a **production ready** state of the
    source code

- **develop**:

  - The `origin/develop` branch always reflects the **latests** delivered
    development **changes for the next release**.
  - This is where the **automatic nightly builds** are built from.

When the code in the **develop** branch reaches a **stable point** it should be
merged back into the **main** branch and **tagged** with a **release number**.

Therefore, every time **changes are merged into the main branch** this results
in a **new production release**. And we can use a `git hook` to **automatically
build and roll-out** to our production servers every time there was a commit on
main.

## Supporting branches

A set of **parallel** branches that have a **limited lifetime** and will be removed
when no longer needed.

They have a specific purpose and **strict rules** as to **which** branches may
be their **originating branch and which** branches must be their **merge
targets**.

### Feature branches

- May **branch off** from:

  - `develop`

- Must **merge back** into:

  - `develop`

- Branch **naming convention**:

  - _anything_

This branches often **only exist** in **developer repos** and not in **origin**

#### Workflow (Feature)

- **Create** a feature branch

```sh
  git checkout -b myfeature develop
```

- **Incorporate** a finished feature **on develop**

```sh
  git checkout develop
  git merge --no-ff myfeature
  git branch -d myfeature
  git push origin develop
```

### Release branches

- May **branch off** from:

  - `develop`

- Must **merge back** into:

  - `develop` and `main`

- Branch **naming convention**

  - `release-<version-number>`

It supports **preparation** for a **new production release**. So they allow for
**minor bug fixes** and **preparing meta-data** (version number, build dates,
etc). So, **bug fixes** may be applied **in this branch** rather than on the
`develop` branch.

The moment to **branch off** to a `release` branch is **when** `develop`almost
reflects the desired state of the new release. **No new features must be merged**
into this **branch from that point where is branched** off from develop.

It is **here** where the upcoming **release** gets **assigned a version number**,
not any earlie since it is here where we finally **know the set of features
that** will **define the new release**

#### Workflow (Release)

- **Create** a release branch:

Where `./bump-version.sh` reflects a **change** in files that manage **version bumps**

```sh
  git checkout -b release-1.2 develop
  ./bump-version.sh 1.2
  git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2"
```

- **Finish** a release branch:

The **next commit** on `main` must be **tagged** for easy **future reference**
to this historical version.

```sh
  git checkout main
  git merge --no-ff release-1.2
  git tag -a 1.2
```

Finally, the `release` branch needs to **be merged back** into `develop`, so
that future releases also **contain any bug fixes**. Then we can **finally
remove the branch**

```sh
  git checkout develop
  git merge --no-ff release-1.2
  git branch -d release-1.2
```

### Hotfix branches

- May **branch off** from:

  - `main`

- Must **merge back** into:

  - `develop`|`release` and `main`

- Branch **naming convention**:

  - `hotfix-<version-number>`

  They are meant for an **unplanned production release**, for when a critical
  **bug** in a production version must be **solved immediately**

#### Workflow (Hotfix)

- **Create** a hotfix branch:

Don't forget to **bump the version number** after branching off

```sh
  git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 main
  ./bump-version.sh 1.2.1
  git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2.1"
  git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem" # work on fixing
```

- **Finish** a hotfix branch:

First **merge back** into `main`

```sh
  git checkout main
  git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
  git tag -a 1.2.1
```

Next, include the bugfix in `develop` and remove the brach

```sh
  git checkout develop
  git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
  git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1
```

When a `release` branch **currently exists**, the `hotfix` changes need to be **merged**
into that **release branch, instead of develop**. **Unless** that bug fix is
**absolutely necessary** for `develop`
