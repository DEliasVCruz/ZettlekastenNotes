# lang.py.syntax.enumarate

Loop with for loops and counters

## Synopsis

```py
  for count, value in enumerate(values):
      print(count, value)
```

## Overview

In Python, a `for` loop is done over an [iterable](./p7q9.md), wich means that no
counter is need. But if you do want to have a **variable that changes on each
loop**, you `enumarate()` instead of creating and incrementing the variable
manually

Since this is an **iterator**, you **can't acces** it's itmes **by indices**

## Cookbook

### Determine the starting value of the count

Since Python sequence types are `0` based indexes, the **default** starting value
**is 0**. But **you can** pass an argument to **set the starting value of the count**

```py
  values = [a, b, c]

  for count, value in enumerate(values, start=1):
      print(count, value)

  # 1 a
  # 2 b
  # 3 c
```

### Get the next value of an enumerate instance

You can use Python's built-in `next()` to get the next value of an **iterator**
like the **enumerate instance**

```py
  values = ["a", "b"]
  enum_instance = enumerate(values)
  next(enum_instance)       # (1, 'a')
```
