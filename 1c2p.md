You can achieve greater performance by using `vectorization`

## Overview

When working with [pandas](./czyt.md) it is tempting to use the
traditional `for loop` approach for manipulating the data, but
this can be very inefficient since `python` it's self is
not a fast language

Otherwise you may reach for keeping operations to the
domain of `pandas` by using it's provided [index](./271q.md) 
manipulation, [accessor](./4sli.md) `api` or the [apply](./slpd.md) function

However, though this will be faster than using the
standard `python` language, since this operation will be
done with fast `C` implementations, we can get even
better performance by structuring our data manipulation
to take advantage of `vectorized` operations
