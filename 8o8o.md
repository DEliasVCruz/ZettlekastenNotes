### Create a new aws iam role

You can create a new `IAM` role by using the `create-role` sub-command, you must
give the new role a name and a **policy document** to use for the new role

- In this example we use an inline trust policiy

```sh
aws iam create-role --role-name my-new-role --asume-role-policie-document \
'{"Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow", "Principal": \
{"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"}, "Action": "sts:AsumeRole"}]}'
```
