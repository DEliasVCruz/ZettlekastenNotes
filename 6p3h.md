Working with Pony entity instances

## Synopsis

```py
  <Table-Class>[[<id>]|.get(<attrs>)]
```

## Overview

You create instance entity object like any other [object
instantiator](./unhs.md), you don't need to pass them to a variable for them to
be saved. It will be done automatically after leaving the `db_session`

- Newly created instance object are only valid inside a `db_session`
- If you want to save a new object before living the session call `commit()`

## Cookbook

### Retrieve an object by it's primary key

You **retrieve** an specific entity instance by **passing** it's `primary-key`
value. If it's a `composite-key`, just pass it's value one by one

- **Raises** `ObjectNotFound` if object with such `primary-key` not found

```py
  customer1 = Customer[123]                     # Customer with pk 123
  order_item = OrderItem[oreder1, product1]     # Composite pk item
```

### Retrieve an object by unique combination of attributes

You can use the `get()` method of the entity class to **retrieve** an object
that **matches** the **attribute combination given**

- You need to specify the names of the attributes and it's values
- Usually used for searching by it's **secondary unique key**
- **Raises** `MultipleObjectsFoundError` if more than one result
- Returns `None` if no object is found

You can use `get()` with `primary-key` when you **want** to get `None`
**instead of** `ObjectNotFound` exception **if** the **object does not exists**
in database

- This **returns** an **entity instance**, and not an object of the `Query` class

```py
  product1 = Product.get(name='Product1')
```

### Traversing an entity relationship

You can traverse the `foreing-keys` or `sets` of an entity to inspect it's
attributes. You can also **iterate trough** `sets`

```py
# Get the an attribute of a referenced foreing key entity

  order = Order[123]
  customer = order.customer
  print customer.name

# Iterate over the orders set of a customer entity

  c = Customer[123]
  for order in c.orders:
      print order.state, order.price
```

### Updating values on an entity

You can **update** the **values** of the attributes of an entity by **normal
assignment**. **Or by using** the `set()` method of the entity class table,
that allows you to **update many attributes at once**.

- You can also pass a [dictionary](./0loj.md)

```py
  order = Order[123]
  order.quantity += 10
  order.date_shipped = datetime.now()

# Or doing it with the set() method

  order.set(state="Shipped", date_shipped=datetime.now())
```

### Bulk update values of many entitles

You can update many entiies at once with the `update()` function. That takes a
`for-loop` [comprehension](./7lub.md) expression

```py
  update(p.set(price=price * 1.1) for p in Product
                                  if p.category.name == "T-Shirt")
```

### Delete an entity record

You can delete an **specific entity** record **by calling** the `delete()`
method **on it**

```py
  Order[123].delete()
```

### Bulk deleting entity records

You can bulk delete by either:

- Using the `delete()` function with a `for-loop` comprehension expression
- Calling the `delete(bulku=True)` method on a `select()` query object

Keep in mind that when doin so by using the `delete()` method of a
[query](./ca6a.md) **hooks won't work** when bulk deleting

```py
# With the delete() function

  delete(p for p in Product if p.category.name == 'SD Card')

# With the .delete() method

  Product.select(lambda p: p.category.name == 'SD Card').delete(bulk=True)
```
