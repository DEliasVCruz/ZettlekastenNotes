Look up domain name servers

## Synopsis

```language
host [<flags>] name [<dns-server>]
```

## Overview

You can use this to perform simple `DNS` lookups. This most
usefull when wanting to convert names to `IP` addresses and
vice versa

- `name`: Is the domain name to be look up
  - It can also be an IPv4 or IPv6 (colon delimited) addres
    in which case it will perform a reverse lookup
- `dns-server`: Can be either be the name ofr IP adress of the
  `dns` server that it should query instead of the server or
  servers listed in `/etc/resolv.conf`

It serves as a simple alternative to the much feature rich
command [dig](./faaj.md) 

## Cookbook

### Get the `mx` records of a `dns` name

You can use the `-t` flag specified with the `mx` field
to get the associated `mx` records of a `dns` name

If there is more than one they will come with a number
that tells their priority, a lower number indicates a
higher priority

```sh
host -t mx <name>

# <name> mail is handled by 10 <record-name>
# <name> mail is handled by 20 <record-name>
```
