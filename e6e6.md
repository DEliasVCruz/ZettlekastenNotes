How to declare and work with variables

## Synopsis

```c
int myNumber;
myNumber = 4;
```

## Overview

You have to declare your variables before you use
them, including their `type`. There is no type 
inferance in `c` so you have to always declare your
variable type

But you can declare your variables withouth having
to asign them a value

### Types

There are several type of variables in `c` here are some
general basic types

- Integers: For whole numbers that can be positive or negative
  - `char`, `int`, `short`, `long`, `long long`
- Unsiged Integers: For whole numbers that are **only** positive
  - Defined by prefixing the type with `unsigned`
- Floating point numbers: For numbers with fractions (real numbers)
  - `float`, `double`
- Strings: We use an array of characters to define a string
- Structures: custom data types composed of other types

The differnt type of variables define theri bounds, and some numeric
data type like `long` have different ranges on different computers.

- A `char` is an `8 bit signed` number between -128 and 127
- An `int` is a `32 bit signed` number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647

### Declare and asign multiple variables

You can define and declare multiple variables of the
same type

```c
int first = 1; second = 2;
int third, fourth;
```

### Use boolean in `c`

In `c` there are no `boolean` types, you can define them
yourself with

```c
#define BOOL char
#define FALSE 0
#define TRUE 1

BOOL played = FALSE;
```

You can also use the `<stdbool.h>` library to get access
to the `bool` type, though this may be plataform specific

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool played = false;
```

### Increase the scope of a local variable

By default, variables are local to the scope in which they
are defined

But they can be declare as `static` to increase their scope
up to the file containing them

> This will not make them `global` and thus they won't be
> able to be used by other files that are including them

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int runner() {
  /* this will only be set once at first call */
  static int count = 0;

  count++;

  return count;
}

int main() {
  printf("%d\n", runner()); // This prints "1"
  printf("%d\n", runner()); // This prints "2"

  printf("%d\n", count); // This prints "2"

  return 0;
}
```

### Typecast a variable

You can interpret a `void pointer` variable as some type 
by using the `typecast` syntax (since the `void pointer` 
does not have a type)

```c
person *myPerson = (person *)malloc(sizeof(person));
```
