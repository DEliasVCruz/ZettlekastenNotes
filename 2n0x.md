# lang.c.read.stdin

Read from the standard input into your program

## Synopsis

```c
char my_string[10];

char *str_read = fgets(my_string, 10, stdin);
if (!str_read) return;
```

## Overview

> Do not use the `gets` function it's unsafe and it's
> deprecated

You can use the `fgets`, `getc` and `fgetc` functions from the
standard library to read input from `stdin` in a portable
way

This are blocking functions and will prompt the user to
write their input, before continuing with the program
execution (once they've hit `enter`)

Keep in mind that this functions may not read all that
it's in the `stdin` buffer and multiple subsequent calls
may still read from what was left on the buffer, so make
sure to finish consumming everything in the buffer if you
expect reading from the begingn again

This functions are not limited to `stdin` and can be used
with any opened [file handler](./mdav.md)

## Cookbook

### Read a single character at a time from `stdin`

You can use the `getc`, `getchar` and `fgetc` functions
from the `<stdio.h>` standard library to read a single
character from `stidin` at a time

> The only difference between `fgetc` and `getc` is that
> `fgetc` is garanteed to be implemented as a regular
> function, meaning you can get a pointer to it and pass
> it around if you want. While `getc` might be implemented
> as a macro that will evaluate it's arguments multiple
> times (so the arguments should be side effect free)

- `getchar`: Is the same as `getc` but `stdin` is implicit
- `getc`: Returns a single charcter typecasted as an `int`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int input = getc(stdin)
if (input == '\n') {
  return;
}
```

### Read multiple characters at once from `stdin`

You can read multiple characters at a time from `stdin` using
the `fgets` function from the `<stdio.h>` library

It will read at most `n-1` characters from `stdin` at a time and 
write it to an specified buffer.

It will put the `\0` null terminator character after the last
character of has been read. So on every call it will write
at most `n-1` characters from `stdin` plus the null terminator

It will read and consume the `\n` character if encountered, (which
migh not necessarily be the result of `enter`) and it will stop 
reading if it encounters it (or `EOF`)

> It does not allocate a buffer, but it does return the
> pointer to the provided buffer

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
  char buffer[10];

  // Will read up to 9 characters and add `\0` at the end
  char *input = fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
  if (input == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  printf("You entered: %s", buffer);

  return 0;
}
```

### Parse formatted input from `stdin`

You can use the `scanf` function for reading formatted input
from the `stdin`. It differes from `fgets` in that:

- It does not stop reading when encountering `\n`
- You need to provide a maximum amounto of characters in the
  the read template to not overflow
- When reading a string with `%s` it will stop at a white space
- It allows you to read a formatted input and stored directly
  onto other variables

It will be easier to use than `fgets` when wanting to read a
single string up to a number of characters (since it's garanteed to
stop reading when encountring white space)

- An example of the difference between `scanf` and `fgets`

> Input: "Hello World\n"
> 
> Using `fgets(buffer, 100, stdin)`:
> 
> +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+
> | H | e | l | l | o |   | W | o | r | l | d | \0 |
> +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+
> 
> Buffer contains: "Hello World"
> 
> Using `scanf("%99s", buffer)`:
> 
> +---+---+---+---+---+----+
> | H | e | l | l | o | \0 |
> +---+---+---+---+---+----+
> 
> Buffer contains: "Hello"
> 
> Remaining Input Stream: " World\n"

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
  char buffer[100];

  printf("Enter a string: ");
  scanf("%99s", buffer); // Use a width specifier to avoid buffer overflow

  printf("You entered: %s\n", buffer);

  return 0;
}
```

### Flush the `stdin` buffer

After you read from `stdin` the precise amount that you want
the user may still have input more characters, if you want to
read again, you'll first have to completely consume what's in
the `stdin` buffer (flush it)

To do this you can call one of the `stdin` string reading 
functions in a loop until you get the `\n` character or `EOF`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// As a while loop
int c;
while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);

// As a for loop
for (int c; (c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF;);
```

### Create a simple input prompt

You can create a simple prompt program by using `getc` in a
loop (while checking for a prompt quitting command) and
flushing the buffer in the end

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char input = '\0';

  // Check for prompt quitting character
  while (input != 'Q') {
    printf("Enter a single character\n");
    printf("> ");

    input = getc(stdin);
    // Reset prompt on `enter`
    if (input == '\n') {
      continue;
    }

    // Do something with the input

    // Flush the input buffer in the end
    for (int c; (c = getc(stdin)) != '\n' && c != EOF;) {
      input = '\0';
    }
  }

  printf("Good bye!");

  return 0;
}
```
