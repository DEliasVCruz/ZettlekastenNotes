# lang.bash.data.array

Represent multiple distintc values in one variable, so that they can be indexed
and used individually

## Overview

An array is a type of variable that maps integers to strings. Which means it
holds a **numbered list of strings**.

There is **several ways** to **create an array** and there is no one single
true way

They are **zero-based indexes** meaning they start at `[0]`

## Cookbook

### Create a simple array

The most simple way to create an array is with the `=()` syntax; Each value in
the array is **delimeted by a white space** and the values are quoted.

Creating an array this way is good for **static data** or a know set of value

```bash
  array_name=("data1" "data2" "data3")
```

You can also specify **explicit indexes**. I even allows you to **leave gaps
between indices**

```bash
  array_name=([0]="Bob" [1]="Peter" [20]="$USER" [21]="Bob Markel")
```

### Using an array

You can perform [variable expasion](./2zqa.md) on arrays too. The `@` index
referest to every element on the array

```bash
  for file in "${myfiles[@]}"; do
    cp "$file" /backups/
  done
```

You can also **reference** an specific element **directly** using the **index number**

```bash
  echo "The first name is: ${names[0]}"
  echo "The second name is: ${names[1]}"
```

### Get the number of elements in an array

You can **find** the **number of elements** in an array by prefixing the
[special parameter](./y2lh.md) `#` to the array name

```bash
  array_name=(a b c)
  echo "${#array_name[@]}"
```

### Expand to a list of the indices of an array

Sometimes you may want to [loop](./2jou.md) with a `for` loop **based on** the
**number of indices** in an array.

For this you may **prefix the array** with `!`, to expand to a **list of the
numbers** in the array in **sequential order**

```bash
  for i in "${!first_name[@])"; do
    echo "${first_name[i]} ${last_name[i]}"
  done
```

### Perform arithmetics with the indices

You can perform **arithmetic operations** inside the `[ ]` for the **array
indices** withouth the need of `(( ))`

```bash
a=(a b c q w x y z)
for ((i=0; i<${#a[@]}; i+=2)); do
  echo "${a[i]} and ${a[i+1]}"
done
```

### Reindex an array to remove the gaps

You may encounter **sparce arrays**, with **non-sequential** indices. To make
them into a nomral sequential array you can **expand them** and it will be as
new

```bash
  array=("${array_name[@]}")      # This re-creates the indices.
```

### Create a dictionary array

To create somethign **similar to a dictionary** we can use **associative
arrays**.

You first have to **declare** them as such with `declare -A <name>` and the
start passing it values

```bash
  declare -A fullNames
  fullNames=( ["lhunath"]="Maarten Billemont" ["greycat"]="Greg Wooledge" )
  echo "My full name is ${fullNames[$lhunath]}"
```

### Append an array in bash

You can append values to an array by using the `+=` operator

```bash
  array_name=()
  array_name+=("Some value")
```
