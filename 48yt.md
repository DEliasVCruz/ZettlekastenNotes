# Steps to design a website

## Ideation and UX

###  Think what you want to accomplish

The best designs come from functional requirements. So think
and write down first what is it that you want to accomplish
with your app/website and how the core user stories are
going to be played out from end 2 end

Think about what are you actually going to include in it, don't
make mockups and designs of things you are not going to
use or include

Keep a list of:
  - The wants: What you want your website to have
  - The features: What things can be down in the website
  - The user stories: How you users are going to interact from
    the moment they first get to your website moving to what
    they want to accomplish and finally leaving

Figure out who your audience and what they want from your
website, and from that start thinking about the right
headings, paragrahps, buttons, content and images

### Start by moodboarding

In some canvas like program start compiling images, designs
even other websites that speak to you and fit with the
goals you are trying to achieve

This will help you gain inspiration and have a reference
for what works, and figure out what you want to include
in the website

> Don't be afraid to just brainstorm

For example:
  - I want the website to feel: warm and cozy, fun and energetic
  - I want the website to feel: a little bit playful and memorable
  - I also want it to be fun
  - I want people to open my website and think it's something
    interesting or incorporate into their website somehow

Write the pros and cons of the inspirational designs that you 
have looked at

2. Think of the user flow

Laid out how your user is going to interact with the page, 
from the moment it enter until accomplishing something that 
we want to be part of the core experience

- Think about what is your main goal for an specific page
  view

Repeat this processes for every view, in an iterative
manner

## Design of the visuals and UI

### Decide your brand colors

Have on hand the [colors](./9cgk.md) that you want to use, they
should be visually displayed with their relevant technical
information, like `hexcode`, `rgb` and even functionally
like `primary`, `accent`, etc.

Keep in mind what kind of vibe and personality you want
to transmit with your colors

> You will need at least 4 colors, including black and
> white, you can use variations of balck and white

This will no t be a exclusive list, you can use different
shades of those colors through your website

You do want your colors to be as comprehensive as possible,
and each of them can have variations to them, for things
like shades, gradients and transparent versions
  - Background color
  - Text color
    - Text (dim)
  - Primary color
    - Primary (shade)
    - Primary (Gradient)
  - Secondary color
    - Secondary (shade)
  - Accent color
  - Semantic colors (error, success)

Your accent colors are used to add character and style
to your site, use them to design:
  - Buttons
  - Borders
  - Gradiants
  - Icons and bullett points
  - Bolds and highlighting of texts

### Select the typography

Chose a font that compliments the vibes, personality and
feel you want to give to your website

Depending on the kind of website you may want to use a
special kind of font, to stand out from the rest

Or you can use standard system fonts to keep your site
minimal and compatible with most users

Think on how you are going to use fonts and typography to
guide your user through your page, it's not only a stylistic
choice but also a functional one

You can use more than one font in your design, but
don't go over two
  - You can then use `typescale` to find good ratios and
    readable sizes for your fonts

> In general it's best to stick to one font per website,
> just with mixing weights and color in your font's
> typescale you can get very diferent looking and feeling
> text

Just pick a base font size:
  - Either 14 or 16 pixels,
  - Regular weight
  - 100% lightness
  - Create two variants:
    - One where it's just bold instead of regular
    - One where just the lightness is reduced (like 70%)

Try decigining everything with those sizes, when you
absolutely need to, go two pixels up or down from there,
and that is mostly all you need

> Code for document hierarchy, but style for visual
> hierarchy. But design for functionality too

To get the light version of dark based color schemes,
just take the lightness of the color and subtract it
from 100%

## The creative process

1. Learn the basics (tutorials, articles)
2. Find inspiration (Think of potential solutions in your mind)
3. Brainstorm some ideas
4. Step away from the problem for a while (Take a break)
5. Don't fall in love with your ideas
  - Test your design be showing it to your collegues and
    friends to see if they like it
  - Be open to adjust your desing based no feedback

## Adding and testing content

### Start creating the layouts

Try not to just user `Lorem ipsum` when testing how content
fits in your app or website, try to actually add some
content even if it's not going to be used

This helps create realistic expectations of how things are
going to be laid out

You can begin by wireframing by hand or some other method
and when you feel comfortable with an overall design, start
creating more high fidelity prototypes, working your way
up to a final design

Test your components and layouts against different sizes
of text and images and how they are expected to change
based on those circumstances

## Some tips and tricks

For every section that you desing keep asking to your
self: What is the porpouse of this section?

1. Make designs that are repeatable

They make your app and pages simpler and you can re-use
them in different part creating a consistent feeling

2. Break you page intro sections

This way you can focus in one thing at a time

### A hero section

Prabably the most important part since it's what your 
users will see first

- Create a bold heading to display

- It should answer this main question
  - What problem are you solving, that the user
    currently have?

- The user don't care about the website, only
  the solution they are providing

- Great headings are just solutions

- Follow up the heading witha small paragrahp
  ideally of not more than 2 or 3 sentences

- Add an image, video or product demo to compliment
  the heading

- Add a call to action, what ever you goal is put it
  as a clear actionable button

You can have your hero section be laid out into two
columsn, which is easer to implement in responsive
designs

Or you can design it for one column, but make sure
that it works and transitions properly in different
screens

> Most of the time a good heading is an offering
> that your competition doesn't have

Ex:
  - Unlimited downloads, unlimited fun
  - No ads, no privacy risks

### More information about your product

Once again, stay away from fluff and unecesary visual
get straight to the point

> The more transperncy the better

- A captivating image of the feature of the product
- A heading on how that feature solves a problem
- A paragrahp with details that will help the user
  choose you over the competition

This is crucial if you managed to get the user attention, 
now you need to gain their trust

So explain each feature as sincerly as posible, to
help them understand and decid

Explain the pricing and make it easy for them to
choose you over competitors
