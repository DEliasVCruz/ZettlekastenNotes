Define functions and execute them

## Synopsis

```c
int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

## Overview

Functions in `c` are very simple, but a little limited

- Functions recieve either a fixed or variable amount of
  arguments
- Functions can only return one value, or return no value

Arguments are **copied by value** to functions, this means
that we can't change the value of the arguments inside the
function scope to affect their values outside

> We can however achieve that by passing pointers

## Cookbook

### Defining a `main` function

Every `c` program has to have an introduction function
this is the `main` function

It's expected that `main` functions return an `int`
where `0` is returned if everything went as planned or
a non `0` number if an `error` occurred

```c
#define <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, World!")

  return 0;
}
```

### Correctly define functions

In `c` functions must first be define before they are used
in code. 

This can be done either by: 
  - Declaring them first, in a header file, and implement
    them later in some library code
  - By declaring them first in the begining of the `c` file

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* function declaration */
int foo(int bar);

int main() {
  printf("The value of foo is %d\n", foo(1));
}

/* function implementation */
int foo(int bar) {
  return bar * 2;
}
```

### Create functions without return values

You can also create a function that does not return any
value by using the `void` keyword

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void print(char *value) {
  printf("%s\n", value);
}

int main() {
  print("Hello World");
}
```

### Create a locally scoped function

By default `functions` in `c` are global, meaing they can be
used both inside the file where they are define and by
any other file that includes them

This is sometimes not desirable, since you may not want
all your functions to be accessible by other files, like
in the case of **helper functions** 

You can use the `static` keyword to scope a function to
only be used inside the file where it was define

> In escence this means that all functions are exported
> by default and you have to manually decide which functions
> are not

```c
static void helper(void) {
  printf("I'm a static function\n");
}
```

### Create a function with no arguments

You can create a function that does not accept arguments
by defining it's arguments as `void`

> You can also just set the argument as `()`

```c
void print_hello(void) {
  printf("hello\n");
}

void print_world() {
  printf("world\n");
}
```

### Passing arguments by reference

When you pass variables to a `function` they are passed `by value`,
which means that a local copy of the variable is made to the
stack the new function

If you wan't to manipulate the original variable you need to pass
it a `reference` to the variable by accepting a [pointer](./xl2p.md)

```c
void add_one(int *number) {
  (*number)++;
}

int n;

printf("Before: %d\n", n);
add_one(&n);

printf("After: %d\n", n);
```

### Returning an array-like from a function

In `c` you can't return an array or an array-like, like
a `string`, from a function directly

> Remeber that a string is an array of characters terminated
> by the zero byte `Ob00000000`
