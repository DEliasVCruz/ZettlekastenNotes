# lang.js.fetch



## Synopsis

```language
const response = await fetch("/my-endpoint")
```

## Overview

### Why you have to await twice?

Consider the standard way to read an `http` response

```js
// first await
let response = await fetch("/some-url")

// second await
let myObject = await response.json()
```

- Firstly, because `response.json()` returns a promise
- But most importantly, it's because of the `http` protocol

> JSON parsing it self is an synchronous operation `JSON.parse('{}')`

The first await is for the `headers`, this are always returned first
as soon as they arrive, even if the status code is a failure

The second part correspond to the request `body`, this can usually
be much bigger than the header and thus it's parsed separately, and thus
something like `response.json()` returns a [promise](./zjtg.md)

```js
let response = await fetch("/some-url")

// At this point,
// 1. the client has received the headers
// 2. the body is (probably) still making its way over.

let myObject = await response.json()

// At this point,
// 1. the client has received the body
// 2. the client has tried to parse the body
// as json with the goal of making a JavaScript object
```

> Remember thou that `response.json()` doesn't resolve actual json
> but to rather enconde it as a json string

You could actually read sequentially the `body` response as a stream of bytes
and encode it on the fly as you receive it
