# lang.go.pkg.runtime

Measure memory statistics at runtime

## Synopsis

```go
import (
    "runtime"
)

func main() {
  var m runtime.MemStats

  runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
}
```

## Overview

You can use the `runtime` package to read memory statistics of your
go applications

The package provides the `MemStats` structs that can be populated 
with all the memory statistics

The `.Alloc` attritbute represents the number of bytes currently
allocated for heap objects in a go program

  - This means it's the memroy currently in used by our program
  - You coudl use this stats to for example:
    - Locate a memory leak
    - Find out a large allocation, in the case that there is a suddenly
      spike in the allocated bytes

The `.TotalAlloc` attribute describes the acumulate total number of bytes
allocated for heap objects since the program started running
  - This means this value only ever increases
  - We can use this to see how memory intensive is our program throughout
    it's lifetime

The `.Sys` attribute represents the total number of bytes of memory obtained
from the operating system
  - This inlcudes all `heap` and non `heap` memory used
    - Like it includes memory reserved but not necessarily used
  - This basically represents all the memory that the `runtime` has obtained
    from the operating system
  - This can be seen as the total **foot print** of our program in the 
    system's memory

The `.NumGC` attribute represents the number of completed garbage collection
cycles since the program started
  - This field is increased whenever the `go` runtime cleans up memory that
    is no longer being used
  - Frecuent garbage collections might indicate high memory preasure
    - Also `GC` is a **stop the world** action that can slow down your
      program's operations

## Cookbook

### Get all the memory statistics of your program at a given point

You can use the `ReadMemStats` function to read all the memory statistics
of your programm at a given point in time and write them to the `MemStats`
struct for inspecting them

> The attributes of the `MemStats` struct are all `uint64` types that
> represent sizes in `bytes` if you want to get another representation
> like `megabytes` then you will need to do that conversion your self

```go
import (
    "runtime"
)

func printMemStats() {
  var stats runtime.MemStats

  runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)

  fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MB\n", bytesToMegabytes(stats.Alloc))
}

func bytesToMegabytes(bytes uint64) uint64 {
  kilobytes :=  bytes / 1000
  megabytes := kilobytes / 1000

  return megabytes
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Mem stats before:")
  printMemStats()

  mySlice := make([]int, 1_000_000)
  for index, value := range mySlice {
    mySlice[index] = value
  }

  fmt.Println("Mem stats after:")
  printMemStats()
}
```
