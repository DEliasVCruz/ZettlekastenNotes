# cli.git.cherry_pick

Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to
another.

## Overview

With this you can **choose a specific commit** and **apply it to another branch**
**without tempering** with the **commit history**.

Unlike a merge or [rebas](./7ddq.md), where the whole branch is merged, here
you can select what specific commits you want and exclude others. Also unlike
rebase, this will **leave the original branch history intact**.

It's **not always a best practice**.It can **cause duplicate commits** and in
some cases **traditional** [merges](./drni.md) **are preferred** instead.

Remember this is **not the same as merging**, in it's normal behavior this just
**rearranges the** [commit history](./m36a.md)
