# cli.git.cherry_pick

Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to
another.

## Overview

With this you can **choose a specific commit** and **apply it to another branch**
**without tempering** with the **commit history**.

Unlike a merge or [rebas](./7ddq.md), where the whole branch is merged, here
you can select what specific commits you want and exclude others. Also unlike
rebase, this will **leave the original branch history intact**.

It's **not always a best practice**.It can **cause duplicate commits** and in
some cases **traditional** [merges](./drni.md) **are preferred** instead.

Remember this is **not the same as merging**, in it's normal behavior this just
**rearranges the** [commit history](./m36a.md)

## Synopsis

```sh
  git cherry-pick [<flag-options>] [<commitid>]
```

## Options

- -n: Do not make the actual commit

## Cookbook

### Select and apply commits

If you want to rearrange the commits in your history. This will **create new
commits** on top of where your current branch is pointing to.

```sh
  git cherry-pick <commitid>
```

### Cherry pick without commit straight away

If you wanted to bring the changes in but not commit it inmediately, in case
you wanted to **bring the modifications** and **make some more changes** on top
of them.

```sh
  git cherry-pick -n <commitid>
```

### Fix a commit made to the wrong branch

If a **commit** is accidentally **made to the wrong branch**. You can **switch
to** the correct branch and cherry-pick the commit to **where it should
belong**.

```sh
  git checkedout <correct-branch>
  git cherry-pick <commitid>
  git checkedout <wrong-branch>
  git rebase -i HEAD~n # Drop the wrong commit
```
