Driver for connecting and operating on a PostgreSQL database

## Synopsis

```py
  import psycopg2
```

## Overview

To work with a [psql](./zfos.md) database server you'll need to use the
external library `pscopg2`

It **requires** you to **first install** the program **and setup** a
`PostgreSQL` server

## Cookbook

### Connect to a postgresql database

To connect to a database you'll first have to had setup a `PostgreSQL` server
and then use the `connect()` function to create a connection

You'll need to provide:

- `database`: The name of the database
- `user`: User that it's the owner of the database
- `password`: To password to access the database
- `host`: The host IP address where the database server resides
- `port`: The port number where the database server is listening

```py
  import psycopg2
  from psycopg2 import OperationalError

  def create_connection(db_name, db_user, db_password, db_host, db_port):
      connection = None
      try:
          connection = psycopg2.connect(
              database=db_name,
              user=db_user,
              password=db_password,
              host=db_host,
              port=db_port,
          )
          print("Connection to PostgreSQL DB successful")
      except OperationalError as e:
          print(f"The error '{e}' occurred")
      return connection

  connection = create_connection(
      "postgres", "postgres", "abc123", "127.0.0.1", "5432"
  )
```

### Create a new database

To create a new database you will **first** have to **connect to an existing
database** server.

**If** you are starting with a **brand new database** you can **connect** to the
**default postgres database**

- You **need to create** a `cursor` object to execute arbitrary commands
- From there you can **pass a query** to [create a new database](./pvd1.md)

```py
  def create_database(connection, query):
      connection.autocommit = True
      cursor = connection.cursor()
      try:
          cursor.execute(query)
          print("Query executed successfully")
      except OperationalError as e:
          print(f"The error '{e}' occurred")

  create_database_query = "CREATE DATABASE sm_app"
  create_database(connection, create_database_query)
```

### Execute arbitray commands and queries

To execute arbitray commands and queries you'll need to create a `cursor()`
object and use it's `execute()` method. This **accepts** any **arbitray valid**
`sqlite` query or **expression** as a [string](./4t3v.md)

- For creating tables and inserting records you need to declare:

  - `connection.autocommit`: If `True`, **instruct** to **autocommit all executed
    expressions** with

```py
  query = """
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    gender TEXT,
  )
  """

  def execute_query(connection, query):
      connection.autocommit = True
      cursor = connection.cursor()
      try:
          cursor.execute(query)
          print("Query executed successfully")
      except OperationalError as e:
          print(f"The error '{e}' occurred")

  execute_query(connection, query)
```

### Inserting records into a table

You can reference external values in the form of a [list](./7cxo.md) of
[tuples](./hsr4.md) and reference them with `%s` inside your command to quickly
insert values into a table

Then just **past the list** of values **as a second argument** to the
`execute()` method

```py
  users = [
      ("James", 25, "male", "USA"),
      ("Leila", 32, "female", "France"),
      ("Brigitte", 35, "female", "England"),
      ("Mike", 40, "male", "Denmark"),
      ("Elizabeth", 21, "female", "Canada"),
  ]

  user_records = ", ".join(["%s"] * len(users))

  insert_query = (
      f"INSERT INTO users (name, age, gender, nationality) VALUES ({user_records})"
  )

  connection.autocommit = True
  cursor = connection.cursor()
  cursor.execute(insert_query, users)
```

### Extract queried data

When you perform a `SELECT` query, you need to invoke the `fetchall()` method
that will **return** a `list` where **each element is** a `tuple` that **maps**
to it's **corresponing row**

```py
  def execute_read_query(connection, query):
      cursor = connection.cursor()
      result = None
      try:
          cursor.execute(query)
          result = cursor.fetchall()
          return result
      except OperationalError as e:
          print(f"The error '{e}' occurred")

  select_users = "SELECT * FROM users"
  users = execute_read_query(connection, select_users)

  for user in users:
      print(user)
```
