Working and operations with collections of entities

## Synopsis

```py
  <entity>.<set>
```

## Overview

Sets are like [lists](./7cxo.md) generator like objects that **can be indexed
and operated**

## Cookbook

### Add and remove sets of relationships

If an entity has a set of entities you can **add new** related entities with
`.add()` and **delete them** with `.remove()`

- This takes an instance of an already existing entity

```py
  person1.cars.remove(Car[1])       # Remove car with id 1 from person 1
  print(person1.cars)

# [out] >>> CarSet([])

  person1.cars.add(Car[1])          # Add back car with id 1 to person 1
  print(person1.cars)

# [out] >>> CarSet([Car[1]])
```

### Traverse entities through attribute lifting

When an entity define a set. If you reference the set, you then can **access
the attributes of the set entity as attributes**

This will contain a [dictionary](./0loj.md) of `<value>: <count>` pairs, where
it will display all the **unique values of combine collection** of entities in
the set

```py
  print(p1.cars.model)

# [out] >>> Multiset({u'Camry': 1, u'Prius': 1})

  print p1.cars.make

# [out] >>> Multiset({u'Toyota': 2})
```

### Basic operations on set collections

You can do **basic operations like** what you can do with **most**
[iterables](./p7q9.md)

- **Check for inclusivity** of an entity in a set

```py
  Car[1] in p1.cars

# [out] >>> True

  Car[1] not in p1.cars

# [out] >>> False
```

- **Check** the **number of entities** in a set
  - With either the `len()` function or `.count()` method

```py
  print(p1.cars)

# [out] >>> CarSet([Car[1], Car[2]])

  len(p1.cars)          # 2
  p1.cars.count()       # 2
```

### Iterate over set collections

You can iterate over a set **like** you would on **any other iterable**

```py
  for car in p1.cars:
      print car.model

# [out]:
    Toyota
    Camry
```

### Query methods on collections set

You can use the following [query](./ca6a.md) methods on sets

- `.select(<query>)`: A select query structure
- `.random(<amount>)`: Get a random entity of the set
- `.order_by(<criteri>)`: Order the set by a criteria
- `.filter(<filter>)`: Filter out the set

```py
  group = Group[101]

  group.students.filter(lambda student: student.gpa > 3)[:]
  group.students.order_by(Student.name).limit(1)
  group.students.random(2)

  student = Student[1]
  student.courses.select(lambda c: c.semester == 2).order_by(Course.name)[0:3]
```
