A guide with wath you need to knwo for xml parsing

## Overview

There are **multiple ways to parse xml documents**. This guide helps you
**familiarize with the concepts you need**

### Xml parsers

There are different xml parsers there are **better suited for different needs**.
Each demonstrates different **memory and speed trade-offs**

tâ€™s **possible** to combine **more than one** XML **parsing model**. For
example, you can use SAX or StAX to quickly find an interesting piece of data
in the document and then build a DOM representation of only that particular
branch in memory.

- **Document Object Model** (DOM)

  - **Features**:

    - Standar way to parse a markup language like XML
    - **Not memory efficient** entire DOM is stored in memory
    - Handfull **standar operations** for **traversing and modifying** elements
    - Gives you **random access** to **individual elements**

  - **Best suited for**:

    - Memory is not an issue
    - Convenience is more important than processing time
    - Parse a modertely large document
    - Do parsing infrequently

- **Simple API for XML** (SAX)

  - **Features**:

    - Elemetns are proccessed sequentialy from top to bottom
    - Handle specific nodes as it finds them
    - **Discard elements** if you are not interest in them
    - **Memory efficent**, can deal arbitrarily large files
    - Finding and modifying **random nodes is cumbersome**
    - **Inconvinient** for **handling deeply nested** elements
    - Allows for **read only parsing**

  - **Best suited for**:

    - You need memory and time efficency
    - Parsing very large documents
    - Parsing incoming XML data in real time

- **Streaming API for XML** (STAX)

  - **Features**:

    - Gives you **more control over parsing process**
    - Custom handlers call the parser on demand
    - Enables **lazy evaluation**
    - Performance on part with SAX
