# lang.py.importing

Python code is organized into both modules and packages.

## Synopsis

```py
  from [<package>] import [<module>] as [<alias>]
```

## Overview

You can **modularize** your projects code by separating it into different
files, this are called `modules` in `Python`. You may also couple your modules
into directories for semantic reasons, this directories are called `packages`

Remember, importing a module both loads the contents and creates a namespace
containing the contents.

### The __init__.py module

When you import a package as `import \<package\>` by itself this is the module
that will be runned by the interpreter. Having an `__init__.py` module in
every package is **not mandatory** but it **helps** on **defining initialization
instructions for** when a package is **first imported**

### Absolute and relative imports

Similar to a `unix` system the packages import system can use a **dot
notation** hierarchy structure to define **imports relative to** the **current
module** or **absolute to the project** structure

In general `PEP8` recommends using **absolute imports** whenever possible

## Cookbook

### List the contents of the namespace in your module

You can use the `dir()` built-in function to list the what is your current
module **global namespace** which is the list of **reserved words used by**
[functions](./8xrz.md), [classes](./unhs.md), etc

```py
  import math

  print(dir())      # ['__annotations__', '__builtins__', ..., 'math']
  print(dir(math))  # ['__doc__', ..., 'nan', 'pi', 'pow', ...]
```

### Define what can be imported with "*"

When you use `from [package|module] import \*` you can define what gets imported
with the `__all__` magic variable.

On a package level if this is not define in it's **initialization module** then
using "\*" will have no particular effect

```py
# pkg/__init__.py

  __all__ = [ 'mod1', 'mod2', 'mod3', 'mod4' ]
```

### Create and install a local package

This is one of the best practices if you are working with a big project that
will be very modularized and this modules are expected to be imported and used
in many different ways with minimal breakage

Once a package is installed it will be available to all scripts in your
environment. Once this is done you can use it anywhere without having to worry
about the script directory, relative imports, or other complications.

The simplest way is by defining a `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` files in the outer
structure of your projects

- Prefix your package name with `local_`
- The field `packages` receives the directory path to your package
- The [setuptools](./yvh3.md) module is used to streamline this package creation

```py
# setup.cfg

  [metadata]
  name = local_structure
  version = 0.1.0

  [options]
  packages = structure

# setup.py

  import setuptools

  setuptools.setup()
```

Then **install it with** [pip](./eioz.md) with the `-e` option that allows you
to edit the source code of your package without reinstalling it

```sh
  python -m pip install -e .
```
