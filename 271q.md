# lang.py.module.pandas.index

The indicator of the rows in your dataframe

## Synopsis

```py
  df.index = <Type>Index()
  df.index
```

## Overview

You can access and [operate](././l1ya.md) on your dataframe based on the label
of it's index. All dataframes have an index and by **default** it will consist
of `zero-index` numerical labels

## Cookbook

### Create and index of numbers

You can use the `RangeIndex()` class to create an index where it's label are
continues numbers

```py

```

### Get all your index labels values

You can get all your index labels as a [list](./7cxo.md) with the `index` attribute

```py
  my_indices = df.index
  my_indices[0]                 # The name of the first index label
```

### Get the label of an index by row number

Since the `index` attributes returns a **list** you can operate on it like any
other list an access it's values by their `zero-index` position

```py
  df.index[0]                   # The name of the first index label
```

### Filter based on index labels

You can **select and display** only the **rows that match** a certain in
**index label** with

- `index.isin()`: Returns a `Series` of booleans based on if they match the
  labels in the list

This **will perform** [filtering](./niq3.md) on your dataframe rows

```py
  df[df.index.isin([2017, 2018, 2019, 2020])]
```

### Specified a column as the index

You can **indicate** that a column will **serve as the index** of the dataframe with
the `set_index()` method

```py
   indexed_df = df.set_index('Id')
```

You can also **specify more than one column** as the index of your dataframe
and create a **hierarchical index**

```py
  multi_index_df = df.set_index(['Brand', 'Model'])
```

### Rename the index axis

You can rename the index axis of your dataframe with the `rename_axis()`
method. If you have a **hierarchical index** then you **can pass a list** for the
**name of every part** of the index

```py
  day_names = df.index.day_name()
  hr = df.index.hour

  df.groupby([day_names, hr])["co"].mean().rename_axis(["dow", "hr"])
```
