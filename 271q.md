# lang.py.module.pandas.index

The indicator of the rows in your dataframe

## Synopsis

```py
  df.index = <Type>Index()
  df.index
```

## Overview

You can access and [operate](./l1ya.md) on your dataframe based on the label
of it's index. All dataframes have an index and by **default** it will consist
of `zero-index` numerical labels

The pandas `index` is **not data**, it is convertible to data and often backed
by data, but **it's actually a mechanism**

- It is not garanteed to be unique
- It is not garanteed to be sorted
- It is just some mechanisim for looking up the data

Indexes support [common operations](./z6js.md) and a common `api`

### Types of indexes

You can create various indexes like:

- `RangeIndex`: A range of integer numbers
- `[Int|Float]64Index`: An index based on 64 bit integers or floats
- `DatetimeIndex`: An index consisting of `datetime` data
- `IntervalIndex`
- `PeriodIndex`

### Basic Info

The `Index` object has a set of **attributes** that can give you **useful
information** about the index like:

- `has_duplicates`: A **boolean** of whether there are duplicate values
- `is_monotonic`: **If** the values of the **index** are **in sorted order**
- `is_unique`: **If** the **values** of the index **are unique**
- `has_duplicates`: If the index has duplicate values

## Cookbook

### Create and index of numbers

You can use the `RangeIndex()` class to create an index where it's label are
continues numbers

```py
  data = [[8,2], [2,5], [3,6]]
  idx = pd.RangeIndex(1, 3)   # Range index from 1 to 3
  idx_2 = pd.RangeIndex(1, 10, 2) # Range index from 1 to 10 stepping by 2

  df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=idx, columns=["Hours", "Days")
```

### Get all your index labels values

You can get all your index labels as a [list](./7cxo.md) with the `index` attribute

```py
  my_indices = df.index
  my_indices[0]                 # The name of the first index label
```

### Get the label of an index by row number

Since the `index` attributes returns a **list** you can operate on it like any
other list an access it's values by their `zero-index` position

```py
  df.index[0]                   # The name of the first index label
```

### Filter based on index labels

You can **select and display** only the **rows that match** a certain in
**index label** with

- `index.isin()`: Returns a `Series` of booleans based on if they match the
  labels in the list

This **will perform** [filtering](./niq3.md) on your dataframe rows

```py
  df[df.index.isin([2017, 2018, 2019, 2020])]
```

### Filter a hierarchical index based on an array like

If you have a hierarchical index and you want to filter it based on only one of
it's levels.

You can use the `reindex()` method that takes an array like as the filtering
criteria and determines the level to filter on with the `level` parameter

```py
  df.reindex(date_range('2008-02-01', periods=4, freq='14D'), level='date')
```

### Get the `zero-index` location of a value of the index

You can use the `get_loc()` method of the `Index` class to get the `zero-index`
of a value of the index

```py
  idx = pd.RangeIndex(1, 10, 2)

  print(idx.get_loc(1))             # 0
```

### Get the `zero-index` location of range of values of the index

You can also get a range of `zero-index` location of a range of values in your
index with the `slice_locs()` it returns a [tuple](./hsr4.md) of the range

```py
  idx = pd.RangeIndex(1, 10, 2)

  print(idx.slice_locs(1, 2))       # (0, 1)
```

### Get an array of the values to get based on a range object

You can also get an array of `zero-index` positions to get the values specified
in a range object

It will try to get the values up to the end of the range object, **if it's not
found it will represent it as** a `-1`

```py
  idx = pd.RangeIndex(10, 30, 5)

  print(idx.get_indexer(range(10, 30, 5)))      # array([0, 1, -1, -1])
```
