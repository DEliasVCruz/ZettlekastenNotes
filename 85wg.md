# cli.useradd

Add new users to your system

## Synopsis

```sh
  useradd [<options>] [<user-name>]
```

## Overview

You can use the `useradd` command to add new [users](./fa42.md) to your system
configuration

### Options

Some of the options you can pass are:

- `-m`: Create a home directory for your user
- `-G`: Add secondary groups for your user

## Cookbook

### Add secondary groups for your user

By default when creating users, the user will be added to a group of the same

followed by a comma (`,`) separated list

```sh
  useradd -G wheel <user-name>
```
