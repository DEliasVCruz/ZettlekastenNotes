# lang.c.includes

Use external libraries in your c code

## Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include "lib.c"
```

## Overview

Unlike other programming languages, `c` does not come with
a standard library included as part of the language

But there are some `system libraries` that are usually
provided by the operating system that can be used

This is not limited to `system libraries` you can add
other third party library that you have installed in your
system or files that you have in your project directory

## Cookbook

### Include a system library

Installed system libraries are noted between `<>`, the
most common libraries that are included in almost
every system are

- `<stdio.h>`: Standard Input and Output - Ex. printing/reading from terminal
- `<string.h>`: Functions to deal with strings - Ex. length, comparison, etc

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

### Include other `c` files

You can also add another `c` file that you have in your
project directory by enclosing it with `""`

> Keep in mind that when you include a file like this, it
> gets `inlined` into the file where it's being included

This is not consider best practice in a professional environment,
typically you would write a `header` file that says what you
want to expose from your `c` file and then `link` the compile
file directly

But for recreational purpose this is fine

```c
#include "lib.c"
```
