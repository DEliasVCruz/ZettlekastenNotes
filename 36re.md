### How to undo the changes that a commit made

This will revert the changes that a previous commit on the history made **while
keeping the changes that the commits after the one you want to revert made**

This **will introduce a new commit** without the changes that the reverted
commit made

```sh
  git revert <commitid>
  git push
```

### Revert the changes of a commit

If you want to **revert the changes you did on a commit** and you **haven't yet
pushed them**, then you may be better off with [reset](./z9bi.md)
