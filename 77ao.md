# lang.c.array.stack_allocation

Allocate variable lenght array memory into the stack

## Synopsis

```c
// For c99 and later
char buf[x];

// or for older c standars
char *buf = alloca(x);
```

## Overview

> Normally declared arrays (with explicit constant size)
> are always allocated in the stack, unless using somethign
> like malloc for allocating them on the heap

Before the `c99` standard, variable length `arrays` where
forbidden (which are `arrays` with a non consant size)

Thats why some compilers have a built in macro called
`alloca`, this behaves exactly like [malloc](./mh5c.md) except that
it allocates on the `stack`

It does not need to be cleaned up with a function like
`free` since the compiler handles cleaning up the `stack
frame`

### Create a stack allocated array

There might be times when you want to allocate a buffer
on the stack, but you might not now the exact size of
the buffer at compile time

If you are using `c99` or later you can just declare
a variable length array like so:

```c
void doSmth(int buffSize) {
  // This is allocated in the stack frame of the function
  char buff[buffSize];

  // Or using alloca if your compiler supports it
  char *allocaBuff = alloca(buffSize)

  // We don't need to free the buffers
}
```
