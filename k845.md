# lang.py.module.pdf.pypdf2.append_merge

Merge or concatenate multiple pdf files

## Synopsis

```py
   from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

   pdf_merger = PdfFileMerger()
```

## Overview

You can use the `PdfFileMerger()` class to either:

- **Append/Concatenate**:

  Concatenates **every page** in an **existing PDF** document to the **end of**
  the pages currently in the `PdfFileMerger`

- **Merge**:

  **Inserts** all of the pages in an existing PDF document **after a specific
  page** in the `PdfFileMerger`

The `PdfFileMerger()` objects are **empty** when **first instantiated**. Youâ€™ll
need to add some pages first before doing anything else

## Cookbook

### Append files into one another

You can append pdf files to one another with the `.append()` method that
**takes** a **string representation** of a **file** that will be **appended
to** the **current state** of the `PdfFileMerger()` instance

```py
  from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

  appended_file = PdfFileMerger()
  files = ['file_1.pdf', 'file_2.pdf', 'file_3.pdf']

  for file in files:
      appended_file.append(file)
```

### Insert a pdf file inside another

You can insert the contents of a pdf file **inside** an **arbitrary position**
of another with the `.merge()` method

You **first** need to **append an initial file** to the `PdfFileMerger()`
instance and then you can start inserting others

- The first argument is the index of the file to be inserted at
- The second argument is the string representation of the file to be inserted

```py
  pdf_merger = PdfFileMerger()
  pdf_merger.append('file_1.pdf')

  pdf_merger.merge(1, 'file_2.pdf')     # Insert file_2 at index 1 of file_1
```

### Write into a new file

Once you have finished making any concatenation or merging of your files you
have to **write the result into a new file** with the `.write()`

It works exactly as when you [write pdf](./ealg.md) files with the
`PdfFileWriter()` class

```py
  with open('append_file.pdf', 'wb') as output_file:
      appended_file.write(output_file)
```
