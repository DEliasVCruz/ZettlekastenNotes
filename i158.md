# cli.py.debug.pdb

The command line interface to debug Python code

## Synopsis

```pdb
  python my_debuggin_program.py

  > <file-name>(<line-number>)[<module>|<function-name>]()
  -> <current-non-executed-paused-line>
  (Pdb) <command>
```

## Overview

You can enter the interactive debugger by setting a [breakpoint](./yevw.md) in
your code an running it as you normally would

The interactive session will **automatically launch** once this **breakpoints
are hit**

### Commands

- **General**:

  - `q`: Exist the interactive debugging session
  - `!`: Execute a (one-line) statement in the context of the current stack
  - `restart`: Restart the debugging session

- [Inspect](./ptn3.md):

  - `p <expression>`: Print an expression's value
    - `pp`: Pretty print your expressions
  - `ll`: Print the current context code
  - `l`: Print 11 lines around the current line
  - `a`: Print the argument list of the current function
  - `display`: List all currently watch expression and their current result
  - `display <expression>`: Watch the result of an expression if changed
  - `w`: Print the call stack
  - `whatis <expression>`: **Print** the **type** of the expression
  - `source <expression>`: Try to source code for given object and display it
  - `interact`: Start interactive interpreter with namespace with current local scope
  - `retval`: **Print** the return value for the **last return of a function**

- [Code Stepping](./x711.md):

  - `n`: Step over the next logically executed line
  - `s`: Step into the current code
  - `unt`: Step over to the next code line
  - `r`: Continue execution until the current function returns
  - `j`: Set the next line that will be executed

- [Breakpoint Management](./u9f4.md):

  - `b`: Set a new breakpoint
  - `c`: Continue until a next breakpoint is found
  - `disalbe <bnum>`: Disable a breakpoint
  - `enable <bnum>`: Enable a breakpoint
  - `cl`: Delete a breakpoint (`<bnum>` or `<filename>:<linenum>`)
  - `tbreak`: Create a temporary breakpoint (**deleted after hit**)
  - `ignore <bnum> <count>`: Ignore a break point `<count>` times
  - `condition <bnum> <count>`: Add or change condition for a breakpoint

- [Call Stack Management](./vflo.md):

  - `w`: Print the current call stack state
  - `u <count>`: Go back on the call stack `<count>` times
  - `d <count>`: Go forward on the call stack `<count>` times

## Cookbook

### Repeat the last command

You can just **press** `Enter` multiple times to **repeat** the **last
executed command**

### Execute more than one command in one line

You can write more than one command in one line by **separating them with** `;;`

```pdb
  (Pdb) display var1 ;; display var2 ;; n
```

### Execute general Python statements

You can **execute** (one-line) **statement** in the **context** of the
**current stack**. This is **good for setting new variables**

If you want to **set a variable** in the **global scope** prefix it with the
`global` command

```pdb
  (Pdb) global list_options; list_options = ['-l']
  (Pdb) p list_options
  ['-l']
```

### Create aliases for commands and expression

You can create aliases for complex commands or expressions with the `alias` command

```pdb
# Print instance variables (usage "pi classInst")
  (Pdb) alias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print("%1.",k,"=",%1.__dict__[k])

# Print instance variables in self
  (Pdb) alias ps pi self

  (Pdb) ps
```
